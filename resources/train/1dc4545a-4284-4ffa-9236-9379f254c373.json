[{"section_title": "AbstrAct background", "text": "Cognitive reserve (CR) is one factor that helps to maintain cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether the effects of CR depend on the semantic/executive components of the task remains unknown. Methods 470 patients (138 with AD, 332 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Linear regression models were used to determine the effects of CR (years of education) on cognitive performance after controlling for demographic factors and regional cortical atrophy. First, we assessed memory tasks with low (Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) discriminability), moderate (AVLT delayed recall) and high (Logical Memory Test (LMT) delayed recall) executive/ semantic components. Next, we assessed tasks with lower (digit span forward, Trails A) or higher (digit span backwards, Trails B) executive demands, and lower (figure copying) or higher (naming, semantic fluency) semantic demands. results High CR was significantly associated with performance on the LMT delayed recall, approached significance in the AVLT delayed recall and was not significantly associated with performance on AVLT discriminability. High CR was significantly associated with performance on the Trails B and digit span backwards, mildly associated with Trails A performance and was not associated with performance on digit span forwards. High CR was associated with performance on semantic but not visuospatial tasks. High CR was associated with semantic tasks in patients with both MCI and AD, but was only associated with executive functions in patients with MCI. conclusion CR may relate to executive functioning and semantic knowledge, leading to preserved cognitive performance in patients with AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "IntroductIon", "text": "Cognitive reserve (CR) is the retained ability to perform cognitive tasks despite loss of neuronal function from neurological disease. 1 Many factors have been found to influence CR, including education, occupational status and participation in social and leisure activities. 2 3 In persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, CR is thought to be one factor that explains why patients with similar amounts of disease burden can have markedly different performance on clinical and neuropsychological assessments. 4 The biological mechanisms through which CR exerts its influence remain unknown, although potential explanations include brain reserve, brain maintenance, neural reserve and neural compensation. 1 5 Brain reserve refers to structural changes at baseline, such as increased numbers of neurons or synapses, which allow the brain to tolerate a greater degree of pathology. Brain maintenance proposes that CR results in neuroprotective effects, such that neuronal tissue is less susceptible or resistant to neuropathology. Neural reserve is the retained ability to perform a cognitive task due to increased efficiency or capacity within the neural network typically involved in performing that task, while neural compensation maintains functionality through the use of general semantic knowledge, problem-solving and executive functions. Determining the mechanism of CR may provide insight into targeted, novel interventions for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, with the aim to potentially delay the onset of clinically significant impairment from AD pathology.\nNeural compensation can be due to increased general knowledge, sometimes referred to as semantic knowledge, 5 or due to executive functions that allow for flexible problem-solving. 1 Therefore, tasks that allow a subject to use semantic and/ or executive skills to improve performance should show particularly strong effects of CR if neural compensation is contributing. In contrast, CR would be expected to improve performance on all tasks within a cognitive domain equally if neural reserve is responsible. Here, we assess for neural compensation by determining whether the beneficial effects of CR are due to the semantic and/or executive components of the task. First, we test the effects of CR on memory tests with low, moderate and high semantic and/or executive components. We hypothesise that CR will exert a greater influence on tasks with high versus low executive and/ or semantic components. Next, we directly assess tasks with lower versus higher executive functions, and lower versus higher semantic components, to determine if CR also exerts a greater effect on high component tasks."}, {"section_title": "Methods Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database ( adni. loni. usc. edu).

After a sixth trial of 15 distractor words, subjects are then asked to remember as many objects on the list at 30 min spontaneously (delayed recall) and to select previously learnt words on a list consisting of 15 learnt words and 15 distractor words (delayed recognition). In order to correct for word registration, which is a function of verbal working memory, we measured the delayed recall score as the proportion of words registered on trial 5 that were spontaneously recalled after a 30 min delay. Discriminability was determined using recognition scores at 30 min. To account for false alarms to non-studied items, we derived a measure of discriminability, d-prime (d\u2032), which was calculated in a standard fashion based on classic signal detection theory. 10 Additionally, because d\u2032 is undefined when either proportion is 0 or 1, we used standard formulas to convert these values: Hits=(#Hits+0.5)/(#studied items+1) and FA=(#FA+0.5)/(#unstudied items+1)."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "The Logical Memory Test (LMT) is a modification of the episodic memory measure from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and involves the immediate and delayed (30 min) free recall of a short story that is read aloud to the patient and contains 25 elements of information (perfect score is 25). We used the 30 min delayed recall score in order to compare directly with the 30 min delayed recall from the AVLT.\nBecause AVLT discriminability involves minimal demands on memory retrieval, there is a lower opportunity to use semantic and/or executive skills to improve performance. In contrast, the AVLT delayed recall provides some opportunity for semantic/ executive skills to be incorporated, although this capacity is limited because none of the words are designed to be phonetically or semantically related. 9 Finally, the LMT involves remembering semantically related elements of a story, allowing for the greatest potential to use semantic and executive skills to improve task performance. This categorisation is consistent with prior models of memory function that have differentiated verbal memory tasks according to whether the information is arbitrary or semantically associated. 12 Executive processing was measured using the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, 13 digit span forwards and digit span backwards.

This is in line with several previous studies demonstrating higher levels of pathology in those with high CR compared with those with low CR at similar estimations of disease severity and neuropsychological performance. 4 7 25-33 However, it is also possible that microanatomical differences, such as synaptic count and differences in dendritic branching, could contribute to brain reserve and would not be reflected in measures of cortical atrophy or pathological disease burden. 34 Brain maintenance can be tested by looking at the rates of disease progression in patients with high and low CR. While some studies have found slower rates of amyloid-beta deposition in normal controls with high CR and slower progression of hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose-PET longitudinally in patients with AD with higher CR, 35 others have shown no difference in cortical atrophy over time in low versus high CR patients with MCI and AD. 32 Additionally, while prospective studies in non-demented older individuals have shown that patients with higher CR determined by education, occupational status and leisure activities have lower risk of progressing to dementia, 2 3 36 those with high CR who are diagnosed with AD show faster rates of decline in memory function 37 38 as well as processing speed and global cognitive function. 39 40 These data suggest that CR modulates performance up to a certain level of disease burden, but that continued disease progression overwhelms compensatory mechanisms involved in CR, leading to more rapid deterioration in cognition late in the disease course. 1 Our study was not designed to assess the longitudinal progression of disease severity over time; however, we did find that CR exerted broader effects on task performance in patients with milder (MCI) versus more significant (AD) impairments in a cross-sectional sample.\nOur study more specifically attempted to differentiate between neural reserve, in which CR is associated with task performance for all tasks within a cognitive domain equally, and neural compensation, in which CR specifically modulates performance dependent on the semantic and/or executive components of the task. When analysing each patient group separately, the association of CR with task performance in patients with MCI was related to both executive and semantic components, while CR only influenced performance on tasks with semantic components in patients with AD. One possible explanation is that executive functions contribute to CR in patients with MCI, while in patients with AD this capacity is lost due to disease progression. This would be consistent with prior studies showing an association between executive functions and functional preservation in patients with MCI. 41 Our finding that CR is associated with performance on tasks with higher semantic components fits with prior studies showing patients with MCI have hyperactivation in brain regions involved in semantic memory, compared with cognitive neurology age-matched controls. 42 This is also consistent with models differentiating arbitrary versus semantic components of verbal memory. 12 While learning arbitrary verbal associations are hypothesised to localise to mesial temporal lobe structures, semantically associated verbal memory is thought to involve a more widely distributed network of brain regions, allowing for neural compensation. 12 As the cognitive effects of education result from years of intervention, it remains unclear whether similar effects can be seen after relatively shorter durations of cognitive rehabilitation interventions. However, prior systematic reviews have found that multifaceted cognitive and social interventions improved cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD, while interventions targeting specific cognitive domains may be less effective. [43] [44] [45] [46] Interventions targeting general, college-level educational classes, for instance, led to improved cognitive performance in a group of elderly individuals. 47 "}, {"section_title": "limitations", "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, our population was taken from the ADNI database, which may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the general population. Specifically, the average educational level in this cohort is much higher compared with the general population or populations used to study CR in the past. Nevertheless, finding significant effects of CR even within this highly educated population (eg, finding significant effects of CR between college and graduate levels of education) suggests a relatively high ceiling effect for CR.\nSecond, we used only one marker of CR, education, although occupation 2 and leisure activities 3 have also been found to be markers of CR. Additionally, several recent studies 6 7 have used the ANART as a marker of CR, which may more accurately reflect CR compared with education and show less gender bias. However, while the ANART as a marker of premorbid IQ is felt to be relatively resistant to the deleterious effects of ageing and neurodegenerative disease, this is not universally accepted. 48 While ANART is relatively preserved through prodromal AD, there is deterioration in the ANART score in patients with AD as their disease progresses. 49 Furthermore, the effects of education and ANART on neuropsychological task performance are similar. 6 As the ANART was shown to independently correlate with performance on the BNT in normal controls, 7 and the ANART has been used as a surrogate test of semantic knowledge and verbal intelligence, 5 using the ANART would have introduced a potential confounding factor in our analysis. For these reasons, education was thought to be a more appropriate measure of CR for the main analyses in this study.\nFinally, our study was limited by specific neuropsychological tasks available from the ADNI study. A more direct, prospective evaluation of performance on neuropsychological tasks specifically designed to assess the effects of CR on tasks varying in semantic and executive components is therefore necessary. Additionally, our study was a cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between cognitive performance and CR. Longitudinal and/or interventional studies are needed in order to infer causality between CR and mechanisms of task performance. Finally, impaired performance on the LMT was used as part of the inclusion criteria for patients enrolled in the ADNI study. Because these measures are normed according to education, this introduces bias into our results. However, finding similar effects of CR on the LMT performance using the ANART instead of education, despite the limitations in using the ANART mentioned above, supports the validity of our results."}, {"section_title": "conclusIons", "text": "Our study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of CR in patients with MCI and AD are dependent on the executive and semantic components of the cognitive task.
