Studies of species abundance provide little inSight into the underlying causes of the decline unless demographic parameters also are determined (Van Home 1983 , Askins et al. 1990 ). Therefore, focus has shifted from estimating trends in abundance to estimating demographic parameters and movement rates (Roth and Johnson 1993 , Martin 1995 , Robinson et al. 1995 , Anders et al. 1997 ).

Despite the need for red-cockaded woodpecker management, managers are concerned that this management regime may degrade hardwood midstory and understory breeding habitats for some Neotropical migrant species by increasing predator abundance along habitat edges and increasing foraging distances (Lucas 1994) .\nWe chose the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a study species because (1) it nests in hardwood midstory and understory tree species (Roth et al. 1996) , (2) it is large enough to carry a radiotransmitter (Powell et al. 1998 ), (3) it is abundant at our study site, most importantly in areas that were slated for red-cockaded woodpecker silviculture, and (4) it is a species of concern. North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data .show that wood thrush populations in eastern forests have declined 1.8% per year (P < 0.001) during 1966-95 (Sauer et al. 1996) , with the most marked decline from 1978-88 (-4.1%, P < 0.001; Sauer and Droege 1992).

We selected 3 compartments as experimental units and 4 as controls in anticipation of the onset of silviculture (the intervention) midway through the study. Experimental compartments were burned and thinned between the 1994 and 1995 field seasons. Control units were not burned or thinned during our study, or the previous 8 years except for small harvests for disease-or fire-prevention. Although our study groups could not be randomized, our design includes temporal (before-after) and spatial controls (control vs. experimental) and replication (except for survival as a response), as in an optimal impact study design (Green 1979:68-70 ). We selected the 5 compartments C-8 (364 ha), C-11 (412 ha), C-12 (369 ha), C-23 (364 ha), and C-25 (378 ha) for initial study during 1993-96.\nManagers on PNWR burned and thinned C-8 and C-12 during the winter of 1994-95 (C-8: 166 ha burned, 42 ha thinned; C-12: 130 ha burned, 38 ha thinned). Treatments were not completed on a third experimental compartment when required, so we added 1 new control compartment (C-24, 348 ha), and 1 new experimental compartment (C-31, 297 ha), in 1995. Compartment 31 was thinned in winter 1995-96 (0 ha burned, 199 ha thinned), 1 year later than C-8 and C-12. Because of this staggered entry of compartments, the sample size of experimental compartments in the density experiment declined from n = 3 for a first-year response to n = 2 for a second-year response."}, {"section_title": "Field Methods", "text": "Bird surveys, vegetation sampling, and capture of birds were conducted on 2 0.5-x 1.0-km rectangular plots located in each compartment. Plots were situated to bisect streams and habitat gradients and to assure sampling of all habitat types in each experimental and control compartment. Plots on experimental compartments were situated to include areas to be affected by thinning and burning. Two 1,000-m transect lines, located 125 m from the edges of the plot, served as the baselines for bird and vegetation sampling.\nWe surveyed all study plots 8 times during 1993 and 16 times annually during 1994-96 commencing in mid-May to avoid counting migratory birds. We conducted surveys from sunrise to 1000 hr on rain-free days by slowly walking transects, locating male wood thrushes by vocalizations, and pacing the perpendicular distance to the transect line. At least 1 experimental and 1 control compartment were surveyed each day, and we varied the starting point to avoid temporal detection biases (Robbins 1981) .\nWe captured wood thrushes by 3 methods. First, we used 25 nets, systematically located 40 m apart along the 1-km transect lines on all study subplots, to obtain a representative sample from all habitats used by wood thrushes (Powell 1998 ). Nets were opened and checked for birds from sunrise to 1000 hr for 4 days, then moved to a new compartment. Second, we targeted 8-10 nets in known wood thrush territories from sunrise to 1000 hr and 1700-2100 hr until >1 birds were captured. We closed nets in the event of heavy rain, high winds, or temperatures >30'C. Third, we captured juveniles by hand or with an insect net at the nest during fledging. In this paper, we refer to all hatch-year birds as juveniles.\nWe determined the age of each captured wood thrush by feather and beak morphology, and sex by the presence of a brood patch or cloacal protuberance (Pyle et al. 1987 ). We banded each bird with an aluminum U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division (BRD) leg band; during 1993-94 we also marked birds with individually color-coded plastic leg bands. We fit a subsample of banded adults and juveniles with 1.6-g Holohill Systems, radiotransmitters (battery life of 45 days) using thigh harnesses (Rappole and Tipton 1991). As a precaution against negatively affecting an entire brood (Rappole et al. 1989 , Powell et al. 1998 ), we only radiomarked half of the juveniles in a nest.\nWe marked adults with transmitters on 1 experimental (C-12) and 1 control compartment (C-25), with radiomarked males and females distributed evenly between experimental and control compartments; thus, our inferences on survival effects are not based on replication. We deployed half the transmitters (10/compartment) for adults in a staggered manner beginning on 24 April, with the remaining half deployed in mid-June. We re-marked 9 pairs of adults (3 in 1995, 6 in 1996) during the breeding season after battery failure. We radiomarked juveniles throughout the season, beginning in mid-May, and attempted to radiomark juveniles on C-12 and C-25. However, nest failures on C-25 prevented adequate samples of juveniles. Therefore, we added juveniles from other control compartments (3 on C-11, 5 on C-23, 2 on C-27) to increase the radiomarked sample (C-27 was not part of the original design, but fit the requirements of a control compartment). Radiomarked birds were periodically located from sunrise to sunset using triangulation from truck-mounted antennas, followed by visual location using hand-held antennas. where S denotes estimated survival, E = experimental, C = control, B = before treatment, and A = after treatment. We approximated the variance of &i using the delta method (Weir 1990: 44). Under a hypothesis of no treatment effect, the relationship (ai) between experimental and control survival should remain the same after treatment (Green 1979 : 68, Eberhardt and Thomas 1991). We defined an effect parameter, A,, as the difference between aB and aA, which was zero if no effect occurred. We calculated a 95% CI on A,,, and determined whether the CI included (no effect) or did not include (effect) zero; equivalently, we also computed a z-test of the null hypothesis of no effect (Ho: A,, = 0). As noted earlier, our survival inferences were not based on spatial replication. Therefore, we also conducted a randomization test to determine if the estimates we obtained for each study group differed from that expected by chance (Carpenter et al. 1989 ). We conducted 1,000 bootstrap randomizations of the 4 control-experimental, before-after point estimates, and for each we computed a z-statistic that we compared to the z-statistic obtained under the observed data structure. We estimated the probability of Type I error as the proportion of randomizations in which the computed z-statistics exceeded or equaled the observed z-statistic (Edgington 1995:41). We also computed 100-day Kaplan-Meier estimates (Pollock et al. 1989 , White and Garrott 1990) for comparison to other studies and for a description of temporal variability in survival rates and survival differences between adults and juveniles. However, because of few mortalities, these estimates were not used to evaluate the effects of silviculture on survival.\nSurvival from We predicted B using the individual-based recruitment model of Powell et al. (1999) , in which / is a function of our estimates of (1) female breeding season mortality, (2) nest success, (3) number of fledglings per successftil nest, (4) juvenile breeding season mortality, and (5) season length and time between nesting attempts.

Wood thrush density was negatively correlated with compartment-specific area of saw timber-sized pine (Pearson R2 = -0.5326, P = 0.007), but hardwoods and younger pines were not correlated with density (P > 0.05).\nStep-wise regression selected bottomland (BH) and upland (UH) hardwoods as the best model (R2 = 0.820, P < 0.001), and upland hardwood accounted for 78.9% of the variation in density (D1 = -0.086BH + 0.122UH)."}, {"section_title": "Breeding Season Survival", "text": "We radiomarked 13 adults during 1993 (10 males, 3 females), 31 during 1994 (18 males, 13 females), 44 during 1995 (19 males, 25 females), and 43 during 1996 (21 males, 22 females).

(1995) for Sj, than \nSilviculture treatments did not have a negative effect on population growth rates at PNWR. The higher k on experimental compartments after the burning and thinning was largely due to differences in juvenile survival and nest success, although we detected no significant positive effect of red-cockaded woodpecker silviculture on the individual parameters (Lang 1998). Our modeling exercise underscores the necessity for more research on juvenile songbird survival in management contexts.\nAlthough the wood thrush population in Georgia is apparently declining (Sauer et al. 1996) , our results indicate that the PNWR population may be stable. However, our model predicted considerable variation in X among study compartments and years. In the Great Smoky Mountains, another large, contiguous forest like PNWR, Simons and Farnsworth (1996) predicted an average wood thrush population growth rate of 1.10. However, they did not simultaneously obtain survival estimates in the field for adult and juvenile wood thrushes-a critical piece of the population growth model. The large variances we report for population growth rates after extensive data collection and parameter estimation underscore the caution that should be used when classifying populations as sources or sinks from point estimates with no variance component.\nAlthough growth rates predicted by our stochastic model are within the range of population growth rates predicted from density estimates (ktD), the prediction of XtD for experimental areas was almost 20% greater than the model's mean prediction. At least 2 factors could account for the discrepancy between the predictions. First, our stochastic model contains many assumptions, including constant juvenile survival duirng the first year and no mortality during migration. Field estimates for these parameters do not exist for songbirds, and the parameters are critical for accurate predictions of population growth rates. Second, predictions of ktD may be affected by between-year movements of wood thrushes in or out of PNWR. Lang (1998) and Powell (1998) reported that within-year emigration probabilities from PNWR compartments are large and movement distances are landscape scale. Therefore, population growth rates predicted from annual density estimates may be more descriptive of the regional population and should not be used to determine local habitat effects on demographic parameters."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation Changes", "text": "We did not detect a change in the basal area of softwoods due to red-cockaded woodpecker silviculture (time period x study group interaction, P = 0.351).

On the contrary, the stochastic model predicted that population growth rates increased on experimental compartments and decreased on control compartments after silviculture treatments. However, 95% CI for our effect parameter (A,) was large, especially for apparent annual survival.\nForest thinnings and burns covered less than half of the experimental compartments, and the thinnings and burns were not drastic changes to the landscape. Wood thrushes are highly mobile species (Powell 1998 ) that can move easily to unaffected areas when necessary, which may explain why survival did not change after the silviculture. The high mobility of wood thrushes emphasizes the need for a study design that includes both controls and replications across time and space when studying the effects of an environmental impact (Green 1979 )."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Parameters", "text": "Demographic rates of wood thrushes at PNWR may be unique, as PNWR is an uncommonly large, contiguous habitat near the southern edge of the species' range.

We believe our data are the first to suggest differences within the breeding season for passerines. Our data indicate that only 61% of female wood thrushes live through a 6-month breeding season, whereas 100% of males survived the same time period. Payevsky et al. (1997) reported that males of several avian species had higher annual survival than females, but our data are the first to suggest differences within the breeding season for passerines. Return rates for female wood thrushes at PNWR are lower than males (Powell et al. 1998 ), but differences in philopatry could also be responsible for these observations (Marshall et al. 1999 "}, {"section_title": "MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS", "text": "The PNWR may manage its forests differently than nearby private and public land managers, but thinning and prescribed burning are common methods of forest management. Because the wood thrush population on PNWR appears to be stable while the population is declining state-wide, PNWR's silviculture practices may be a model worthy of replication throughout the region. Although our experimental design provided temporal and spatial controls, this was a relatively short-term study. During our 4-year study, the population growth model predicted differences in population growth rates as large as 11% on control compartments. Our estimates of apparent annual survival and breeding season survival and our tests for an effect of red-cockaded woodpecker silviculture on survival also showed considerable uncertainty. We suggest that long-term monitoring of population responses to management is needed to fully understand and manage these systems (Walters 1986).\nThe survival of juveniles is critical to maintaining songbird populations, and juvenile habitat requirements should be a high priority during habitat management decisions. Female survival during the nesting period may also be improved through habitat management. Therefore, continued use of the current management regime at PNWR should result in adequate habitat for wood thrushes and similar songbirds, while providing new colony sites for red-cockaded woodpeckers."}]
