The common p.D358A variant (rs2228145) in IL-6R is associated with risk for multiple diseases and with increased levels of soluble IL-6R in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that the p.D358A allele leads to increased proteolysis of membrane bound IL-6R and demonstrate that IL-6R peptides with A358 are more susceptible to cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17. IL-6 responsive genes were identified in primary astrocytes and microglia and an IL-6 gene signature was increased in the CNS of late onset Alzheimer's disease subjects in an IL6R allele dependent manner. We conducted a screen to identify variants associated with the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in APOE 4 carriers. Across five datasets, p.D358A had a meta P = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and an odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.12 -1.48. Our study suggests that a common coding region variant of the IL-6 receptor results in neuroinflammatory changes that may influence the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in APOE 4 carriers."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "IL-6R is a receptor for IL-6, a cytokine that can trigger a range of cellular responses including inflammation [1] . IL-6R is primarily expressed in myeloid lineage cells in both transmembrane and soluble (sIL-6R) versions. On cells expressing transmembrane IL-6R, IL-6 binds to a complex of IL-6R and gp130, inducing cis-signaling. The transmembrane IL6-R can be cleaved and shed as sIL-6R. Unlike many cytokines, sIL-6R is not a decoy receptor. On cells that express gp130 but not transmembrane IL-6R, IL-6 and soluble IL-6R form a complex with membrane bound gp130 to induce trans-signaling [1] .\nA common variant in IL-6R, p.D358A (rs2228145) has been associated with multiple phenotypes, with A358 increasing risk of asthma [2] , higher sIL-6R serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels [3, 4] , lower serum C-reactive protein levels [5] and serum fibrinogen levels [6] , and reduced risk of coronary heart disease [7] and rheumatoid arthritis [8, 9] . Amino acid 358 is within a predicted metalloprotease cleavage site of the IL-6R receptor and the A358 variant is thought to play a role in increased shedding of the extracellular portion of the receptor [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .\nIn the central nervous system (CNS), IL6R is primarily expressed by microglia. We hypothesized that alterations in the ratio of transmembrane to soluble IL-6R, conferred by the D358A variant, may result in detectable gene expression changes in neurodegenerative diseases, including late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a key pathway in the development and severity of LOAD [16] . LOAD is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline [17] . Individuals with LOAD have regional neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, plaques containing amyloid-\u2424, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of tau [17] . Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in European and African American populations have identified >20 loci associated with LOAD risk [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and several of the risk genes are likely to influence inflammation, including TREM2, CR1, CD33, and INPP5D. The APOE 4 (APOE4) allele accounts for the largest fraction of the heritable risk of AD (20-40%) [26] . There are three forms of APOE that are defined by haplotypes of two coding variants (2, 3, 4) . By age 85, 11% of the general population will develop LOAD, compared to 55% of APOE4 homozygotes and \u223c25% of APOE4 heterozygotes [27] . Although APOE4 is the strongest common variant associated with LOAD, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the age of disease onset, even among APOE4 carriers.\nWe investigated the mechanism by which the IL-6R D358A allele leads to increased sIL6R, and looked for evidence that this functional variant contributes to the pathophysiology of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)", "text": "CSF data for IL-6R levels and genotype was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni. usc.edu) and individual data was downloaded from the LONI website.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD.

In the astrocyte-enriched samples, 68 genes were upregulated and 246 genes were downregulated following IL-6 + sIL-6R treatment (adjusted p < 0.01 and log 2 fold change > 2; Fig. 2A ). In the microglia-enriched cultures, 33 genes were upregulated and 6 genes were downregulated after IL-6 + sIL-6R treatment compared to controls (Fig. 2B) using the same significance and fold change filters. Differential expression of the top IL-6 + sIL-6R responsive genes was confirmed by qPCR (Supplementary Table 1) .\nAs expected, genes significantly upregulated in astrocytes and microglia were enriched in immune related Gene Ontology categories, including \"inflammatory response\", \"response to stress\", and \"acute-phase response\" (Supplementary Table 2) . Gene set enrichment analysis [36, 54] (GSEA, see Methods) also identified previously identified IL-6 responsive gene sets derived from non-CNS cell types (Supplementary Table 3 ). The top 25 upregulated genes in each cell type were selected for further analysis and were used to generate IL-6 responsive gene sets (Supplementary Table 1 , Supplementary  Figure 3B , C)."}, {"section_title": "IL-6 responsive genes are enriched in brains of A358 carriers with AD", "text": "Matched genotype and gene expression data were obtained from a recent study of the temporal cortex of LOAD patients (n = 94) and normal healthy controls (n = 124) [35] . Combining the genotype and expression data, we analyzed the effect of the A358 and D358 IL6R variants on the expression of genes derived from the astrocyte and microglia experiments. First, we used GSEA as a sensitive method to examine the behavior of the IL-6 responsive gene sets in the LOAD expression data. Astrocyte-specific IL-6 responsive genes were significantly enriched in LOAD patients with the A358 allele (p = 0.003; Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table 4) . The microgliaderived gene set was also enriched among A358 carriers though to a lesser degree (p = 0.01, Supplementary Table 4) .\nTo assess the impact of APOE4 status on the IL-6 responsive gene sets in IL6R A358 carriers, LOAD patients were divided into two groups; APOE4 carriers and APOE4 non-carriers. Within each of these groups, IL6R A358 carriers were compared to D358 carriers and the behavior of the IL-6 responsive gene sets were examined in the resulting data using GSEA. In the APOE4 carrier group, the astrocyte gene set remained significantly enriched in IL6R A358 carriers (p = 0.019), but the microglia gene set did not (p = 0.107) (Supplementary Figure 4A ; Supplementary Table 6 ). The astrocyte IL-6 responsive gene set was also significantly enriched in APOE4 non-carriers with the A358 allele (p = 0.040) with the microglia gene sets again not reaching significance (p = 0.065) (Supplementary Figure 4B; Supplementary Table 4) . These data show that in both APOE4 + and APOE4-AD subjects, astrocyte derived IL-6 responsive genes were significantly enriched in carriers of the IL6R Fig. 2 . IL-6 induced gene expression in astrocytes and microglia. A,B) Volcano plot for IL-6 and sIL-6R treated astrocytes and microglia. Average log 2 (fold change) versus -log 10 (p-value) for all genes in the (A) astrocyte and (B) microglia samples. The top 25 genes upregulated by IL-6 and sIL-6R treatment by fold change are noted by color (blue, astrocytes; orange, microglia; gold, both). C) IL-6 set enriched in patients with AD and IL6R risk variant. Density of the t-statistics is shown for all genes in human AD patients (grey), astrocyte set (blue), and microglia set (orange). Each t-statistic is measuring the relative difference between the average expression in patients who carry A358 and those that do not (after adjusting for APOE, sex, and batch). The individual gene statistics of the set are plotted below the density plots. IL-6 responsive gene set densities are shifted to the right, indicating higher expression of these genes in A358 carriers compared to non-carriers. The astrocyte set has the highest level of enrichment among A358 carriers with 40.9% of genes upregulated in this set (p = 0.003) and the microglia gene set is also enriched (p = 0.0267).\nA358 allele. APOE4 carriers were also compared to APOE4 non-carriers regardless of A358 status to rule out enrichment of the IL-6 signature due to APOE mediated inflammatory effects. There was no evidence of enrichment of any of the gene sets in this comparison (Supplementary Figure 4C ; Supplementary Table 4) , consistent with a model in which differential expression of IL-6R responsive gene sets is driven primarily by the IL-6R genotype.\nWe next examined individual IL-6 responsive genes in an attempt to increase sensitivity and specificity. We pre-specified genes to combine into a summary response score based on the highest observed summed fold change in the IL-6 treated astrocyte and microglia arrays that also had validation by qRT-PCR. The top pre-specified and validated genes (SERPINA3, TIMP1, TGM1 and FN1) were then tested in LOAD patients with the A358 genotype Fig. 3 . Elevated IL-6 responsive score in IL6R A358 carriers. A) IL-6 responsive scores for each subject. The score is calculated as the normalized sum of the modified expression (adjusted for batch and sex) of four genes (TIMP1, TGM1, FN1, and SERPINA3). The score is significantly higher among AD patients with A358 versus D358 (p = 0.0080) IL6R variant. Whiskers represent interquartile range. B) Normalized GFAP expression in all patients stratified by disease and IL6R genotype. Note that GFAP expression is higher in AD patients versus controls (p < 1 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ), but that this effect is not dependent on IL6R genotype. Whiskers represent interquartile range. and compared to those with the D358 genotype. We found significant enrichment of these genes in A358 carrier brains, with SERPINA3 (p = 0.0016) and FN1 (p = 0.046) driving the association and TIMP1 and TGM1 also showing enrichment but to a lesser extent (Supplementary Figure 5A-D) .\nFor each patient, we calculated a score representing the weighted sum of the age-, sex-, and batch-adjusted expression of the IL-6 responsive genes (see Methods). This score is significantly higher among LOAD patients who carry the A358 allele versus those who are homozygous for the D358 allele (two-sided t-test p = 0.0080, Fig. 3A ). There was no evidence of an association between IL6R genotype and the IL-6 responsive score in the normal healthy control subjects.\nAs the individual top responsive genes were induced in astrocytes, and the larger astrocyte gene set was consistently enriched, we examined the abundance of IL-6R signaling components in isolated microglia and astrocytes. In our primary cultures, Il6ra (the IL6R mouse homolog) was highly expressed in microglia compared to astrocytes, and Il6st (encoding GP130) was expressed in both astrocytes and microglia. This suggests that increased shedding of IL-6R from the cell surface of microglia may result in reduced IL-6 cis-responsiveness concomitant with an increase in trans-signaling through gp130 on astrocytes.\nAs the astrocyte derived IL-6 responsive gene set and individual genes in the gene score were enriched in A358 LOAD cases, we examined the expression of GFAP, a marker of astrocytes which can also be elevated under inflammatory conditions. GFAP expression was significantly higher in LOAD versus control subjects (p < 1 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ), but there was no association between GFAP expression and IL6R genotype in LOAD subjects (p = 0.378, Fig. 3B ). This is consistent with a model in which the change in expression of the IL-6 responsive gene signatures is A358-dependent, and not driven by a difference in astrocyte number or activity. "}, {"section_title": "An IL-6R coding region SNP is a candidate modifier of age of onset", "text": "In large genome-wide association studies of LOAD, D358A IL-6R has not been associated with the risk of developing AD [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, we hypothesized that the changes in neuroinflammatory signaling conferred by D358A IL-6R might be enriched in individuals with an earlier age of onset and reduced in cognitively intact elderly individuals that carry the major LOAD risk allele APOE 4. We performed an initial GWAS (primary study) aimed at identifying common variants that modify the effect of APOE risk by comparing 100 LOAD cases and 102 elderly controls that were homozygous or heterozygous for the 4 allele and lacked 2.\nTo augment statistical power, we selected individuals from the extremes of the age distribution and identified cases with early age of onset LOAD (<65 years) and elderly controls (>75 years 4/4,>80 3/4) with no evidence of cognitive decline. The strongest association was found at rs4474240 (OR = 3.42, p = 5.01 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) in the IL-6R region (Supplementary Figure 6A, B) . rs4474240 is on the same haplotype (D' = 0.88, r 2 = 0.1) as a missense variant in IL6R (rs2228145, p.D358A) that has been reported to be associated with LOAD in Han Chinese [55] . Amino acid 358 is a site of cleavage of the IL-6R receptor by ADAM17 (Fig. 4A ) and the A358 variant is thought to play a role in increased shedding of the extracellular portion of the receptor (as discussed above).\nWe examined four additional case/control cohorts (total of 1,145 cases and 889 controls) matching the criteria in the primary analysis for APOE4 status and age, for association to rs4474240 and rs2228145 (IL6R p.D358A). rs4474240 showed significant, but modest, association with early onset AD in the replication cohorts (p = 0.037). In two of the four replication cohorts, IL6R p.D358A was nominally associated: US replication 1 (OR = 1.4, p = 0.086) and US replication 2 (OR = 1.6, p = 0.00062), both cohorts are from single site centers. In two other studies, we observed no significant association for IL6R p.D358A: US replication 3 (OR = 1.01, p = 0.72) and Icelandic (OR = 1.2, p = 0.51). A meta-analysis of IL6R p.D358A in all 5 cohorts resulted in a combined OR = 1.3 and p = 0.0003, using fixed effect metaanalysis (Fig. 4B) . We conclude that IL6R D358A is a candidate modifier of age of onset in APOE4 carriers, specifically associated with early disease onset.\nThe analysis was then extended to an AD case/control cohort of totaling 7,102 individuals (4,121 AD cases and 2,981 controls) without the age and APOE status filters used in the modifier screen above. When the whole cohort was examined for an association to IL6R A358, no significant enrichment is observed, with the frequency of IL6R A358 of 41.0% in AD cases and 40.7% in controls (Supplementary Table 5 ). In order to test whether IL6R A358 was enriched in APOE4 carriers regardless of age of onset, we stratified the cohort by APOE4 status and observed a modest dose effect, with a 40.2% frequency of IL6R A358 in APOE4-carriers (OR all controls = 0.98), a 41.4% frequency in APOE3/4 carriers (OR relative to controls = 1.03) and a frequency of 42.0% in APOE4/4 cases (OR relative to controls = 1.05, Supplementary Table 1 ). The age of onset in APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 carriers was tested for a correlation with IL6R A358 genotype (Supplementary Table 6 ). Among AD cases carrying APOE3/4 and APOE4/4, a frequency of 43.1% (OR relative to APOE4 + controls = 1.17) was observed in cases with an age of onset < 65 years of age, 41.3% (OR relative to APOE4 + controls = 1.09) in those with an age of onset between 66 and 74 years of age, and 40.6% (OR relative to APOE4 + controls = 1.06) in AD cases with an age of onset > 75 years of age. Our data suggests that IL6 R A358 is modestly enriched in all AD cases carrying the APOE4 allele, and is further enriched in cases with an age of onset < 65 years of age."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The 358A variant has been associated with elevated plasma sIL-6R levels in an allelic dose dependent manner [11, 12, 49] and this effect is also true in AD CSF with genotype being a major driver of sIL-6R concentration [4] . In the CSF, heterozygote carriers of 358A had \u223c45% higher levels of sIL-6R than non-carriers, however disease status (AD, MCI, or control) had no significant effect on sIL-6R levels.\nWe sought to determine the functional consequences of increased cleavage and elevated levels of sIL-6R in the CNS of AD cases. We hypothesized from prior studies of IL-6 in peripheral cells expressing IL-6R that IL-6 trans-signaling may be enhanced concomitantly with cis-signaling being impaired in carriers of the rs2228145 variant, as evidenced by observations of reduced STAT3 signaling [10, 56] and reduced CRP release [57] . By examination of gene expression patterns in primary cells we determined that in the CNS, microglia are the primary source of IL-6R and that astrocytes are competent for IL-6 trans-signaling through gp130. In addition to our work, other published studies have also observed higher Il6ra (IL6R) expression in microglia compared to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [58, 59] . The expression of Il6st (gp130) however, is consistently higher in astrocytes versus neurons and oligodendrocytes [60] . We then identified IL-6 responsive genes in these cell types by stimulation with IL-6 and sIL-6R. While some gene expression differences were common between enriched cell types, the majority of differentially expressed genes were unique to either astrocytes or microglia. For example, prominent upregulation of SERPINA3 and TIMP1 was observed specifically in astrocytes. Enrichment of these individual genes in A358 carriers was observed in addition to the composite score analysis revealing a clear elevation of signal in A358 IL6R carriers with AD but little effect in control subjects. The possibility of enhanced trans-signaling and reduced cis-signaling would be congruent with our observation of a strong astrocyte derived IL-6 gene signal in LOAD subjects and a weaker IL-6 signal from the microglia derived gene set (Fig. 5) .\nGiven the most prominently altered genes are predominantly expressed by astrocytes, we examined the distribution of GFAP expression as a way to assess the level of astrogliosis across the sample series. As has been previously observed [61, 62] , there was a significant increase in GFAP expression in AD cases relative to controls, but importantly this occurred independently of IL6R genotype. This suggests that the observed increases in astrocyte IL-6 pathway activity are driven by IL6R genotype and not due to unequal astrocyte densities between groups.\nThough APOE4 is a major risk factor for developing LOAD, it is incompletely penetrant and individuals display a wide-range of age of onset, suggesting that modifiers of APOE4 risk may exist. We designed a genetic modifier screen that compared APOE4 carriers with an early age of onset of LOAD (<65 years) to elderly cognitively intact APOE4 carriers. Our initial study identified a variant in the IL6R locus as a candidate APOE4 modifier, and subsequent studies supported this finding.\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that the IL6R D358A polymorphism leads to increased shedding of IL6R from the cell surface, which in AD cases leads to altered IL-6 pathway activity particularly in astrocytes, and may be associated with an earlier age of AD onset in APOE4 + cases. Therapeutics targeting IL-6 signaling for rheumatoid arthritis have been shown to be efficacious thus further work is warranted to consider inhibition of the IL-6 pathway in AD."}]
