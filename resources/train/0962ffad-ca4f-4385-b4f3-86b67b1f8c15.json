Whether such changes reflect processes associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or exposure to antipsychotic drugs is unknown.\nMethods-In this multisite study, 274 CHR cases, including 35 who converted to psychosis, and 135 healthy comparison subjects were scanned with MRI at baseline, 12-month follow-up, and/or the point of conversion for those who developed fully psychotic symptoms.\nResults-In a traveling subjects sub-study, we observed excellent reliability for measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. Controlling for multiple comparisons throughout the brain, CHR converters showed a steeper rate of gray matter loss in right superior frontal, middle frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortical regions, as well as a greater rate of expansion of the third ventricle, compared with CHR non-converters and healthy controls. Differential tissue loss was present among cases who had not received antipsychotic medications during the inter-scan interval and was predicted by baseline levels of an aggregate measure of pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma.\nConclusions-These findings demonstrate that the brain changes are not explained by exposure to antipsychotic drugs, but likely play a role in psychosis pathophysiology. Given that the cortical changes were more pronounced among cases with briefer durations of prodromal symptoms, contributing factors may predominantly play a role in acute-onset forms of psychosis. Keywords schizophrenia; psychosis; prodromal; MRI; prefrontal cortex; inflammation Evidence of progressive loss of gray matter among clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals who convert to psychosis (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) suggests that disturbances in neuromaturational processes during the transition from adolescence to early adulthood (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) may play a role in psychosis onset. However, a number of questions remain to be answered before such an interpretation would be warranted.\nFirst, this effect may be a secondary phenomenon. Antipsychotic drugs are associated with gray matter decline in animal models (13) and in patients with schizophrenia (14, 15) , including first-episode patients (16) . Because the follow-up scans for converting CHR cases in all longitudinal MRI studies occurred post-conversion, most of the converters (and relatively fewer of the non-converters) received antipsychotic drug treatment during the inter-scan interval. In the only prior study to examine this question, converters who had not received antipsychotics during the inter-scan interval (n=5) did not differ in rate of tissue loss from converters who did receive antipsychotics prior to the follow-up scan (n=5) (5) . However, this comparison was almost certainly underpowered to detect a difference if one exists; in any case, a more conclusive result would emerge from comparing the rate of loss among converters not exposed to antipsychotics during the inter-scan interval with nonconverters and controls.\nIf the accelerated gray matter loss associated with psychosis onset is not a secondary phenomenon, then it could be related to factors that participate in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and related disorders, such as neuroinflammation (17) . Neuroinflammatory markers are elevated in postmortem neural tissue from patients with schizophrenia (18) , and these same markers are associated with microglial-mediated synaptic pruning and dendritic retraction in animal models (19) , thus providing a potential mechanistic basis for the reduced neuropil seen in patients (20) . Although neuroinflammatory processes initiated during prenatal stress exposures could play a role (21) , activation of such processes in association with the synaptic pruning characteristic of adolescent brain development represents an influence more proximal to psychosis onset (12, 17, 20, 21) . Recently, an elevation in plasma-based markers of inflammation and oxidative stress was found to precede and predict onset of psychosis among CHR cases (22) . It remains to be determined whether such markers also predict the acceleration in gray matter loss around the time of psychosis onset.\nGiven that CHR cases are ascertained at different ages and at various points along the putative trajectory toward overt illness, such variability could obscure different subgroups of future converters with different profiles of change in brain structure over time. In particular, accelerated gray matter decline would be expected especially among cases with shorter durations from onset of prodromal symptoms to conversion (because the underlying pathology among cases with longer durations would likely be relatively more slowly progressing). In addition, although studies of early psychosis patients are generally consistent in showing lower volumes in dorsolateral prefrontal, superior temporal, and parahippocampal cortex (23, 24) , prior longitudinal MRI studies are in conflict as to whether the steeper rate of loss in CHR converters is general or specific to these regions (1-7). However, these discrepancies may merely reflect regional differences in measurement reliability and/or between-study differences in statistical power.\nIn this multisite study, 274 CHR cases, including 35 who converted to psychosis, and 135 demographically comparable healthy comparison subjects were scanned with MRI at baseline and at 12-month follow-up and/or the point of conversion for those who developed fully psychotic symptoms (25) . We hypothesized that converters would show steeper rates of gray matter reduction in prefrontal, superior temporal, and parahippocampal regions compared with non-converters and controls and that these effects would be present among cases without exposure to antipsychotic medications during the inter-scan interval. We further hypothesized that the cortical changes would be greatest among cases with a more recent onset of prodromal symptoms and that baseline levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines would predict the rate of gray matter loss especially among converters. We also evaluated statistical power to detect differential change across brain regions by incorporating information on reliability from a traveling subjects substudy."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The study protocol and consent form was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each of the 8 data collection sites (UCLA, Emory, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Zucker Hillside Hospital, UNC, UCSD, Calgary, Yale). Participants were evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) (26) and the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version IV (DSM-IV) (27) at each assessment by trained interviewers who met high reliability standards (ICCs=0.92-0.96) (25) . CHR cases met SIPS/SOPS criteria for a psychosis risk syndrome, (26) excluding cases who had ever met DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic disorder. Control participants were excluded if they met criteria for a psychotic disorder, had a first-degree relative with a current or past psychotic disorder, or met prodromal criteria. General exclusions included substance dependence, neurological disorder, or full scale IQ < 70.\nSubjects included in this report are those with MRI scans at baseline (BL) and at 12-month follow-up (FU) or at the point of conversion to psychosis. Given that nearly all (37/41) of the converters with both BL and FU scans available had converted before the scheduled 12-month FU, few converting subjects had FU scans prior to conversion. To avoid mixing cases whose FU scans occurred pre and post-conversion, the 4 converters whose FU scans were obtained prior to conversion were excluded from the primary analyses (but included in secondary analysis). In total, 35 CHR cases who converted to psychosis, 239 CHR cases who did not convert, and 135 healthy comparison subjects had usable data and were included. These subjects were drawn from the larger pools of subjects (N's=62 converters, 491 non-converters, and 224 controls) who had been scanned at baseline. Subjects with both BL and FU scans available did not differ from subjects with BL scans only on age, sex, education, parental education or socioeconomic class overall or in any group separately (all p-values > .30). 1 Demographic characteristics of the three groups are shown in Table 1 . There were no significant differences in age, sex, site of origin, or socioeconomic class by group. Non-converters had lower parental education than converters and controls, who did not differ. Converters and non-converters had a higher rate of substance use disorders than the controls but did not differ from each other. The inter-scan interval was significantly briefer among converters compared to non-converters and controls, who did not differ. Dividing at the median duration from onset of prodromal symptoms to FU scan among converters (26 months, range=2 to 149 months) produced subgroups of 18 cases with short durations and 17 with long durations. For non-converters, applying the same cutoff resulted in 140 cases with short durations and 76 with long durations (information on age at onset of symptoms was not available for the remaining 23 non-converters).\nAs this was a naturalistic study, subjects were treated in their respective communities according to prevailing standards and the judgment of the treating clinicians, who were often primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists. We collected and coded information on medication prescriptions at baseline, 6-and 12-month follow-up (and at the conversion assessment when relevant). Based on this information, 13 (37%) of the 35 converters and 166 (70%) non-converters had not received antipsychotics during the inter-scan interval."}, {"section_title": "MRI Scans", "text": "Five sites operated Siemens scanners and three sites operated GE scanners, all at 3 Tesla.

Surface-based cortical reconstruction was performed to extract thickness measures by calculating the shortest distance from each point on the gray/white boundary to the pial surface at each vertex, along with subcortical volumetric segmentation (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . The subcortical segmentation procedure assigns a neuroanatomical label to each voxel of the MRI volume using a probabilistic atlas and a Bayesian classification rule (30) . The reconstructed baseline and follow-up scans were further processed using Freesurfer's longitudinal stream to extract change in thickness and volume estimates (33) . This processing stream initializes each time point scan by utilizing an unbiased within-subject template space and average image (34) , created by robust, inverse consistent registration (35) , which has been shown to significantly increase statistical power for detecting subtle changes over time (33) . The Supplementary Material provides details of the quality assurance procedures.\nEach of the 8 sites also recruited one healthy subject (4 males, 4 females) who was scanned twice on successive days at every site to permit evaluation of between-site and test-retest reliabilities using intraclass correlations (ICCs). In addition, the ADNI structural phantom was scanned at each site and processed using the AQUAL2 algorithm (36) . We have previously reported on phantom-based performance metrics as well as two processing streams applied to the traveling human data: cortical pattern matching and voxel-based morphometry (37) . Briefly, the 8 scanners performed within the range of accepted tolerance according to the phantom-based metrics, and all achieved excellent reliabilities for intracranial, brain, gray matter, white matter, and subcortical volumes. Superior reliability was achieved when using surface-based registration (as implemented in Cortical Pattern Matching) compared with standard VBM registration and when applying a global scaling correction. Because Freesurfer incorporates both surface-based registration and global scaling correction but also has a built-in module for voxel-based correction of the Type I error rate (which Cortical Pattern Matching does not), we opted to process the imaging data from the primary study using Freesurfer, and in the Supplementary Material we report the test-retest ICCs for Freesurfer-derived measures of cortical thickness and subcortical and ventricular volumes from the traveling subject substudy."}, {"section_title": "Blood Analytes", "text": "As part of a pilot study, blood samples obtained at the BL assessment for 87 of the subjects with BL and FU MRI scans available (14 converters, 38 non-converters, 35 controls) were processed using the Luminex \u00ae Human DiscoveryMap \u00ae bead-based multiplex immunoassay.

Although particular cytokines may have differential functions (e.g., pro-vs anti-inflammatory) in different contexts, several included in the Luminex panel (i.e., TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, Interferon-\u03b3) are consistent activators of the M1 cytotoxic phenotype of microglia (38) (39) (40) (41) ; these were summed together into an index of pro-inflammatory signaling. Similarly, four analytes most consistently associated with the M2 repair and regeneration phenotype of microglia (i.e., IL-10, GM-CSF, IL-1RN, Chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) (38-41) were summed together to form an index of anti-inflammatory signaling."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Imaging measures were first transformed to annualized rates of change (ARCH) in each cortical voxel and each subcortical and ventricular region of interest (ROI), where ROI ARCH = ((ROI FU \u2212 ROI BL )/ROI BL )/Interval and where Interval is the time between BL and FU scans in years. This approach was preferred to repeated-measures ANOVA because the inter-scan interval varied across subjects (but results that were significant based on annualized rate of change were also significant using repeated measures ANOVA). Primary hypothesis testing was applied to measures of cortical thickness in Freesurfer using the False-Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons at the voxel level. In addition, volumetric measures of the ventricular system and subcortical nuclei were evaluated in separate analyses of variance (ANOVAs), treating hemisphere as a repeated measure where appropriate, and controlling for multiple comparisons by FDR correction. Models included age at BL, gender, site, and group (Converter, Non-Converter, and Control) as predictors.\nSecondary analyses were conducted to determine the contributions of antipsychotic drug exposure, duration of prodromal symptoms, and the plasma indices of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines to the regional measures showing evidence of differential change over time by group status.

On average, the follow-up scan for converters occurred 141 days (SD = 117 days) after conversion.

Importantly, these effects were present among cases who had not received antipsychotic medications during the inter-scan interval, demonstrating that the differential tissue loss associated with onset of psychosis is not explained by exposure to antipsychotic drugs. This finding represents a critical advance, given that antipsychotics clearly complicate the interpretation of progressive brain changes among patients in the first-episode of psychosis (13) (14) (15) (16) . A similar result was observed among unmedicated familial high-risk subjects who showed increasing symptom severity (42) . It is thus possible that progressive gray matter reduction is in some way linked to the pathophysiology of onset of psychosis.\nPrior studies of CHR cases have reported steeper reductions in prefrontal, superior temporal, and parahippocampal regions among converters compared with non-converters (1-7). The sample sizes in those studies were significantly smaller than in the present one, and none employed a voxel-based correction for multiple comparisons. Because the traveling subjects substudy revealed comparably high test-retest reliability across most cortical and subcortical regions, the topographical pattern of differential change in this study primarily reflects regional variation in effect size, which was sufficiently high in right superior and medial prefrontal regions and in the third ventricle to survive rigorous control for multiple comparisons throughout the brain. This study thus strongly confirms prior evidence of differential tissue loss in prefrontal cortex among CHR converters to psychosis, with a topography highly similar to that in the only prior study using surface-based anatomical comparison (2) . The primary advantage of the voxel-based FDR-corrected threshold employed here is that it protects against false positive findings given the number of tests conducted and distribution of observed p-values. Thus, we can have high confidence that the effects that were significant are true positives. Adoption of this conservative threshold might also lead to some false negative results. In fact, there were medium to large effect sizes across most of the remaining bilateral prefrontal cortex (including left and right middle and inferior frontal gyri and frontal pole) and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, as well as in some circumscribed regions of temporal and parietal cortex, overlapping the regions showing differential change in prior studies (1-7).\nHigher levels of a plasma-based aggregate index of pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline were strongly predictive of steeper rates of gray matter reduction in right prefrontal cortex among CHR cases who converted to psychosis. Given that peripheral cytokines can affect brain function (43) , and because the cytokines included in the pro-inflammatory index are potent activators of the M1 cytotoxic phenotype of microglia that result in synaptic pruning and dendritic retraction (38) (39) (40) (41) , it is plausible to hypothesize a mechanistic link between neuroinflammation (i.e., microglial activation) and progressive gray matter loss in individuals who develop psychosis, a hypothesis that should be tested using more direct indicators of neuroinflammatory processes in CHR subjects.\nThe steeper rate of decline in right prefrontal cortex and expansion of the third ventricle were more pronounced among converters with shorter durations than those with longer durations, but the long-duration converters also showed differential change compared with non-converters and controls. This pattern suggests that a steeper rate of tissue loss in these regions, or the factors promoting it, may help to trigger an earlier onset of psychosis. Because there were no significant differences between converters, non-converters and controls in cortical thickness or subcortical volumes at the BL assessment controlling for multiple comparisons, this finding suggests that the reductions in gray matter emerge around the time of onset of psychosis, rather than earlier, among CHR cases. Some but not all prior studies have detected anatomical differences at baseline between CHR individuals who do and do not later convert, despite the use of much smaller sample sizes than that in this study, by focusing on a small number of regions of interest or by otherwise employing a less conservative statistical threshold (1, 3, 4, 44-62) . Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that the CHR criteria are sensitive primarily to acute onset forms of psychosis and may therefore underrepresent cases with more insidious onsets, who might manifest loss of gray matter volume at earlier assessment points due to early life risk exposures, such as fetal hypoxia (63) . Thus, the extent to which future converters manifest anatomical deficits at baseline could also potentially reflect the relative proportions of converters with insidious vs. acute onsets in the sample under study.\nThe question arises as to whether gray matter reduction per se is a causal factor in onset of psychosis. Given that the distributions of cortical gray matter volumes among patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls overlap by 50-75%, it does not appear that there is a critical threshold of cortical thickness (in any one region or combination of regions) below which psychosis develops. Nevertheless, there is likely to be a threshold of integrated synaptic activity and regional functional connectivity that does discriminate those in a psychotic state from others. Gray matter reduction is perhaps best conceptualized as a marker of a set of processes that contributes to reductions in integrated synaptic activity and functional connectivity, which in turn might represent a proximal sufficient mechanism of psychosis onset. Although there are likely mechanisms that disrupt synaptic activity and functional connectivity in psychosis-relevant networks without affecting cortical volume, gray matter reduction is nevertheless an observable and reliably measured phenomenon that appears to play a role in a significant proportion of cases and thereby provides insight into the network of brain regions likely to participate in psychosis onset in general.\nIt is important to note that in this study, as well as in all prior longitudinal studies of CHR cases (1-7) , the follow-up scans for converters occurred after the point of conversion. Although the change in gray matter volume was not correlated with the interval between onset of psychosis and the second scan, it is not yet known whether significant change occurs prior to onset of psychosis. It is, however, reassuring that the absolute magnitude of change in the right prefrontal ROI among the four converters who had FU scans before the point of conversion (i.e., mean\u00b1SD=\u22120.11\u00b10.08mm) was comparable to that among cases whose FU scans occurred post-conversion (\u22120.12\u00b10.11mm) and was greater in magnitude compared with non-converters (\u22120.05\u00b10.13mm) and controls (\u22120.05\u00b10.10mm). When these four cases were included with those who had FU scans post-conversion, converters continued to show significantly greater contraction of right prefrontal cortex (F[2,401]=12.66, p=0.000004) compared with non-converters and controls. Given that in this study and in a prior large study of prodromal youth at these same sites (64), more than 70% of the conversions had occurred by 10-months, future studies are encouraged to time MRI assessments at 2-month intervals from the baseline to ensure at least 2 assessment points prior to conversion for the majority of cases.\nIn conclusion, CHR cases who convert to psychosis show a steeper rate of thinning in prefrontal cortex, an effect that is independent of exposure to antipsychotic drugs and is predicted by plasma analytes indicative of an inflammatory process. Future work is encouraged to confirm a neuroinflammatory signature in the regions showing gray matter loss and to determine whether inflammation precedes and predicts the gray matter loss or is a consequence of it."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
