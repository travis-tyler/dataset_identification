[{"section_title": "", "text": "Producing sufficient numbers of graduates who are prepared for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations has become a national priority in the United States. To attain this goal, some policymakers have targeted reducing STEM attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in STEM fields in college is a low-cost, fast way to produce the STEM professionals that the nation needs (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST] 2012). Within this context, this Statistical Analysis Report (SAR) presents an examination of students' attrition from STEM fields over the course of 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). In this SAR, the term STEM attrition refers to enrollment choices that result in potential STEM graduates (i.e., undergraduates who declare a STEM major) moving away from STEM fields by switching majors to non-STEM fields or leaving postsecondary education before earning a degree or certificate. 1 The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of this attrition by: \u2022 determining rates of attrition from STEM and non-STEM fields; \u2022 identifying characteristics of students who leave STEM fields; \u2022 comparing the STEM coursetaking and performance of STEM leavers and persisters; and \u2022 examining the strength of various factors' associations with STEM attrition. Data from a cohort of students who started their postsecondary education in a bachelor's or associate's degree program in the 2003\u221204 academic year were used to examine students' movement into and out of STEM fields over the subsequent 6 years through 2009. Analyses were performed separately for beginning bachelor's and associate's degree students. For brevity, these two groups are frequently referred to as bachelor's or associate's degree students in this study. Selected findings from this SAR are described below."}, {"section_title": "STEM Entrance", "text": "About 28 percent of bachelor's degree students and 20 percent of associate's degree students entered a STEM field (i.e., chose a STEM major) at some point within 6 years of entering postsecondary education in 2003\u221204. At the bachelor's degree level, biological/life sciences was the most popular field, attracting 11 percent of students, and mathematics and physical sciences were the two least popular fields, attracting 2\u22123 percent of students. At the associate's degree level, a higher percentage of students chose computer/information sciences (9 percent) than other STEM fields (1\u22126 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Attrition Rates in STEM and Non-STEM Fields", "text": "Many of these STEM entrants left STEM several years later by either changing majors or leaving college without completing a degree or certificate. A total of 48 percent of bachelor's degree students and 69 percent of associate's degree students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009. Roughly one-half of these leavers switched their major to a non-STEM field, and the rest of them left STEM fields by exiting college before earning a degree or certificate. Attrition rates in non-STEM fields were as high as or higher than those in STEM fields. At the bachelor's degree level, students in humanities, education, and health sciences had higher attrition rates (56\u221262 percent) than did those in STEM fields (48 percent), and students in business and social/behavioral sciences had comparable attrition rates (50 and 45 percent, respectively) as did students in STEM fields. A closer look at how students left their fields reveals that proportionally more students in education (42 percent) and health sciences (35 percent) switched majors than did students in STEM fields (28 percent). At the associate's degree level, students in selected non-STEM fields had attrition rates ranging from 57 percent in health sciences and 66 percent in business to 70 percent in education and 72 percent in humanities. These rates were generally comparable to that in STEM fields (69 percent). Proportionally more students in STEM fields (33 percent), however, switched majors than did students in business (26 percent) and health sciences (20 percent).\nAmong bachelor's degree students entering STEM fields between 2003 and 2009, nearly one-half (48 percent) had left these fields by spring 2009 (figure 2). Some left STEM fields by switching their major to a non-STEM field (28 percent), while others exited college entirely without earning a degree or certificate (20 percent). Attrition rates varied across STEM disciplines, ranging from 38 percent among mathematics majors to 59 percent among computer/information sciences majors. STEM attrition was more common among associate's degree students than among bachelor's degree students: about 7 in 10 associate's degree students (69 percent) entering STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009. Nearly half of these leavers had switched to a non-STEM major. Among STEM fields, attrition rates ranged from 62 percent among engineering/technology majors to 78 percent among mathematics majors. Students in many non-STEM fields experienced similar or higher attrition rates (figure 2). At the bachelor's degree level, for example, students in humanities, health sciences, and education had higher attrition rates than did those in STEM fields (56\u221262 percent vs. 48 percent). Students in business and social/behavioral sciences had similar attrition rates (50 percent and 45 percent, respectively) as did students in STEM fields. Furthermore, switching majors was more common among students majoring in education (42 percent) and in health sciences (35 percent) than in STEM fields (28 percent). Attrition was also high among students in many non-STEM fields at the associate's degree level, ranging from 57 percent in health sciences and 66 percent in business to 70 percent in education and 72 percent in humanities. All rates (with the exception of the rate in health sciences) were comparable to that in STEM fields (69 percent). However, proportionally more associate's degree students in STEM fields (33 percent) switched majors than did students in business and in health sciences (26 percent and 20 percent, respectively). "}, {"section_title": "Important Factors Associated With STEM Attrition", "text": "In this study, a multinomial probit (MNP) model was used to examine how various factors were associated with STEM attrition, after controlling for related factors. This model was used because the outcomes of STEM entrants can fall into multiple categories-that is, they can persist and eventually earn a degree in a STEM field, they can switch majors and pursue a non-STEM field, or they can quit school entirely without earning a degree or certificate. While a bivariate analysis showed that STEM attrition was correlated with a wide range of factors, including students' demographic characteristics, precollege academic preparation, types of first institution enrolled, and STEM coursetaking and performance, the MNP analysis examined all these factors simultaneously and revealed more information than what bivariate analysis could yield. In terms of switching majors to non-STEM fields, the MNP results showed that the intensity of STEM coursetaking in the first year, the type of math courses taken in the first year, and the level of success in STEM courses bore stronger associations with this outcome than did many other factors. Specifically, taking lighter credit loads in STEM courses in the first year, taking less challenging math courses in the first year, and performing poorly in STEM classes relative to non-STEM classes were associated with an increased probability of switching majors for STEM entrants at both the bachelor's and associate's degree levels. Accumulating higher levels of withdrawn/failed STEM credits was also a critical factor for switching majors among bachelor's degree STEM entrants. With respect to the outcome of leaving college without earning a degree or certificate, the MNP results showed that STEM entrants' overall college performance and their level of success in STEM courses were better predictors than many other factors. Poor performance in college (as reflected by a lower cumulative grade point average [GPA] through 2009) and high levels of withdrawn/failed STEM courses were associated with an increased probability of dropping out of college for STEM entrants for both bachelor's and associate's STEM entrants. Less success in STEM courses than in non-STEM courses (as reflected by earning lower STEM grades relative to non-STEM grades) was also associated with an increased probability of dropping out of college for STEM entrants at the associate's degree level. The MNP analysis also revealed several other patterns that were different from those in the bivariate results. While the bivariate analysis showed that female STEM entrants at both degree levels left STEM fields more frequently by switching majors than their male counterparts, the MNP analysis yielded this result only among associate's degree students. In addition, the bivariate analysis showed that at the associate's degree level, STEM entrants from various income backgrounds had similar rates of leaving STEM fields by switching majors; after controlling for the other variables in the MNP model, however, those from low-income backgrounds were found to have a lower probability of switching majors than their counterparts from high-income backgrounds. The MNP results further indicated that low-and high-performing STEM entrants may exit STEM fields in different ways. At both the bachelor's and associate's degree level, the probability of exiting STEM fields by dropping out of college was higher for low-performing students (i.e., those with an overall college GPA of less than 2.5) than for high-performing students (i.e., those with an overall college GPA of 3.5 or higher), while the probability of leaving STEM fields by switching majors was higher for students in the high-performing group than for their peers in the low-performing group. More research is needed to understand the underlying motivation for leaving STEM fields, particularly among top students. Finally, the MNP analysis confirmed several patterns observed among bachelor's degree STEM entrants in the bivariate analysis. All other factors being equal, bachelor's degree STEM entrants who first attended public 4-year institutions had a higher probability of leaving STEM by switching majors than those who started at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. Bachelor's degree STEM entrants who were male or who came from low-income backgrounds had a higher probability of leaving STEM by dropping out of college than their peers who were female or came from low-income backgrounds, net of other factors. Similarly, bachelor's degree STEM entrants who first attended institutions that were among the least selective had a higher probability of leaving STEM due to dropping out than students who first attended highly selective institutions."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Average marginal effects of various characteristics on the probability of students leaving STEM fields among 2003\u221204 beginning associate's students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009, and "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are widely regarded as vital to a nation's economy. While the United States has long been held as a world leader in scientific and technological innovation, it is facing fierce competition from abroad in producing and retaining STEM talent (National Science Board 2010a). Various sources show that: \u2022 the mathematics and science performance of U.S. elementary and secondary students lags behind their peers in many other nations (Fleischman et al. 2010;Gonzales et al. 2008;Provasnik et al. 2012); \u2022 the rates at which U.S. undergraduates choose STEM majors trail those of several key competitors (National Science Board 2010b); \u2022 the United States has one of the lowest ratios of STEM to non-STEM bachelor's degrees in the world (National Science Board 2012); and \u2022 top U.S. students, who have great potential to become future science and technology innovators, are eschewing careers in STEM fields (Bettinger 2010;Lowell et al. 2009;Zumeta and Raveling 2002). Rising concerns about the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy have led to numerous calls for national efforts to increase the number and diversity of students pursuing degrees and careers in STEM fields (National Academy of Science 2005;National Governors Association 2007;National Research Council 2012;National Science Board 2007). In 2009, the Obama administration launched the \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign to improve the participation and performance of U.S. students in STEM (The White House n.d.). The U.S. Department of Commerce projects that STEM employments will grow faster than non-STEM employment. 2 A recent policy report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST 2012) urged colleges and universities at all levels to produce more STEM graduates, announcing that if the United States is to retain its preeminence in science and technology and remain competitive in a fast-changing economy, it will need 1 million more STEM professionals over the next decade than it is currently projected to produce."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Postsecondary education plays a critical role in building a strong STEM workforce for the future. The U.S. postsecondary education system, however, frequently loses many potential STEM graduates. National data revealed that more than half of freshmen who declared STEM majors at the start of college left these fields before graduation (Chen 2009; Higher Education Research Institute 2010), and more than half of STEM bachelor's degree recipients switched to non-STEM fields when they entered graduate school or the labor market (Lowell et al. 2009;National Science Board 2012). Other studies indicated that many STEM leavers were actually highperforming students who might have made valuable additions to the STEM workforce had they stayed in STEM fields (Seymour and Hewitt 1997;Lowell et al. 2009). To produce more graduates in STEM fields, some recent U.S. policies have focused on reducing students' attrition from STEM fields in college, arguing that increasing STEM retention by even a small percentage can be a cost-efficient way to contribute substantially to the supply of STEM workers (Ehrenberg 2010;Haag and Collofello 2008;PCAST 2012). In light of our nation's need to build a strong STEM workforce for the future, an examination of STEM attrition in U.S. postsecondary education is warranted. Using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09), this Statistical Analysis Report (SAR) tracks a cohort of 2003\u221204 beginning postsecondary students over 6 years (from 2003 to 2009), presenting the most recent national statistics on STEM attrition in college. Capitalizing on the transcript data collected through BPS:04/09, this study also provides a first look at STEM coursetaking at the national level, detailing how participation and performance in undergraduate STEM coursework are associated with STEM attrition. Throughout this study, the term STEM attrition is used to refer to enrollment choices that result in potential STEM graduates (i.e., those who declare a STEM major) leaving STEM fields. STEM attrition can occur at any time in college. The purpose of this SAR is to deepen understanding of this attrition by addressing the following questions: \u2022 What is the STEM attrition rate in postsecondary education? Is it higher than attrition rates in other fields? \u2022 Who leaves STEM fields? Into which fields do they move? \u2022 Do STEM leavers and persisters differ in terms of their STEM coursetaking and performance? \u2022 How are various student, high school, and postsecondary institutional and coursetaking characteristics associated with STEM attrition when taking into account interrelated factors? Which factors are most associated with STEM attrition? To address these questions, this SAR is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on the first two questions, presenting nationally representative statistics on STEM entrance and attrition rates, comparing attrition rates between STEM and non-STEM fields, and examining the characteristics of students who leave STEM fields and the fields into which they move. The second section takes a closer look at STEM coursetaking and performance, determining whether coursetaking patterns and grades of STEM leavers differed from those of STEM persisters. Built on bivariate results in the prior sections, the third section makes use of a multinomial probit model to examine the associations of various factors with STEM attrition, while taking into account the interrelationship of these factors. To provide a context for the analysis, the following section presents a brief review of research literature, defines several key terms used in this study, describes the data sources and sample used for the analysis, and discusses some limitations of this study."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Although one-third of freshmen express interest in STEM majors before starting college (National Science Board 2012), the actual STEM enrollment rate is lower: for instance, STEM majors accounted for just 14 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary education in 2007-08 (Snyder and Dillow 2011). For various reasons, a significant proportion of students who initially intend to study STEM fields abandon them several years later. A recent study found that a total of 56 percent of postsecondary students who declared STEM majors in their freshman year left these fields over the next 6 years (Chen 2009). Although attrition rates of similar magnitude were reported elsewhere (Bettinger 2010;Goulden, Frasch, and Mason 2009;Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010;Lowell et al. 2009), little research has compared attrition rates across different fields to determine whether high attrition is unique to STEM fields or appears in other fields as well. A number of plausible factors may underlie STEM attrition. Studies have frequently found that women, underrepresented minorities, 3 first-generation students, 4 and those from low-income backgrounds leave STEM fields at higher rates than their counterparts (Anderson and Kim 2006;Hill, Corbett, and Rose 2010;Griffith 2010;Huang, Taddese, and Walter 2000;Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010;Shaw and INTRODUCTION Barbuti 2010). In addition, STEM attrition occurs more frequently among students with weaker academic backgrounds (Astin and Astin 1992;Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010;Mendez et al. 2008;Shaw and Barbuti 2010;Strenta et al. 1994;Whalen and Shelley 2010). Next, there is evidence linking STEM attrition to such attitudinal factors as motivation, confidence, and beliefs about one's capacity to learn STEM subjects (Burtner 2005;Huang, Taddese, and Walter 2000). Finally, STEM degrees often take longer to complete than other degrees, so financial aid may take on added importance in retaining students in STEM programs (Fenske, Porter, and DuBrock 2000;Whalen and Shelley 2010). Anecdotal evidence and small-scale studies have identified several course-related factors that may explain why students lose their interest in STEM programs, including negative experiences encountered in gatekeeper or introductory math and science courses 5 (Barr, Gonzalez, and Wanat 2008;Crisp, Nora, and Taggart 2009;Mervis 2010;Seymour 2001;Seymour and Hewitt 1997;Thompson et al. 2007); limited exposure to STEM coursework in the first 2 years (Bettinger 2010); and poor performance in STEM courses, especially relative to performance in non-STEM courses (Ost 2010;Rask 2010;Seymour and Hewitt 1997;Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2011). These findings, however, have not been extensively investigated using nationally representative data. Students' experiences or perceptions of institution and workplace context/climate may be related to STEM attrition as well. Such factors include inadequate academic advising, career counseling, and institution support; feelings of isolation in STEM fields because too few peers pursue STEM degrees and too few role models and mentors are available (mainly pertinent to females and underrepresented minorities); distaste for the competitive climate in STEM departments (women especially); and perceived discrimination on the basis of sex and/or race/ethnicity in the STEM workforce (Blickenstaff 2005;Carrell, Page, and West 2010;Chang et al. 2011;Daempfle 2003;Eagan et al. 2011a;Espinosa 2011;Fouad et al. 2010;Ost 2010;Price 2010;Seymour 2001;Thompson et al. 2007). These contextual and climate factors are now accepted as areas worthy of investigation for explaining the departure of students (especially women and minorities) from STEM fields at various points in college. The review of past research suggests that students' decisions to leave STEM fields are likely to arise from a multitude of factors, underscoring the need to examine models of STEM attrition that include multiple factors simultaneously. In light of this review, the analyses presented in this SAR encompass as many related factors as available in BPS:04/09. Past research has already provided extensive insights into demographic and prior college characteristics; therefore, this study pays special attention to STEM coursetaking and performance in college. Although it is not possible in this analysis to determine exactly how students' curricular experiences affect their decisions to leave STEM fields, the study represents a first step toward understanding the relationship between coursetaking and STEM attrition using nationally representative data."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Key Terms", "text": "To facilitate discussions of the analysis and its results, the following provides the definitions of key terms used in this study. STEM fields can include a wide range of disciplines. 6 In this study, the following fields are classified as STEM: mathematics; physical sciences; biological/life sciences; computer and information sciences; engineering and engineering technologies; and science technologies. 7 For a detailed list of the fields designated as STEM in this SAR, see appendix C. Non-STEM fields, by definition, include all fields that are not STEM fields. Rather than combining all non-STEM fields into one group, this study specifically compares STEM fields with the following five fields: social/behavioral sciences; humanities; business; education; and health sciences, because these fields had adequate sample sizes for analysis in BPS:04/09. For more detail on the fields in each major category, see appendix C. STEM entrance is used to refer to a student's majoring in a STEM field of study in college. In BPS:04/09, STEM entrance can be identified at three points in time: during the 2004 base-year survey and during the 2006 and 2009 follow-up surveys. In this study, any student who reported a STEM major at one or more of these three points is considered a STEM entrant between 2003 and 2009. INTRODUCTION STEM leavers are a subgroup of STEM entrants who leave STEM fields either by switching their major to a non-STEM field or by leaving postsecondary education without earning a degree or certificate (for brevity, the latter group is frequently referred to as students who dropped out of college or college dropouts below). In BPS:04/09, STEM leavers consist of STEM entrants who (1) had not attained any degree or certificate by 2009 and were not enrolled in that year; (2) were enrolled in a non-STEM field in 2009; (3) were not enrolled in 2009 and had attained one or more degrees only in non-STEM fields; or (4) were not enrolled in 2009 and had attained more than one degree (one in a STEM field) but whose most recent degree was in a non-STEM field. 8 STEM persisters are a subgroup of STEM entrants who remain in STEM fields throughout their college career. In BPS:04/09, STEM persisters consist of STEM entrants who either were enrolled in a STEM field in 2009 or, if not enrolled that year, had attained their most recent degree in a STEM field. STEM attrition rate is the number of STEM leavers divided by the total number of STEM entrants."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Sample", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "The analysis described in this report is based on data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). BPS:04/09 followed a cohort of students who began postsecondary education in 2003\u221204 for a total of 6 years, through 2009. BPS sample members were initially identified in the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04). 9 8 Fewer than 20 sampled beginning bachelor's and associate's degree students attained more than one degree by 2009, with one or more of these degrees in a STEM field. Most of them first attained a certificate or an associate's degree in a STEM field and then switched out of a STEM field and attained a bachelor's degree in a non-STEM field. Thus, it is reasonable to consider these students as STEM leavers though they have attained a STEM degree at some point during college. If students began as a STEM major and later transferred to another institution where they changed their major, they were considered to have switched majors. 9 NPSAS:04 is a nationally representative sample of about 90,000 undergraduate, graduate, and firstprofessional students in about 1,600 postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico who are eligible to participate in federal Title IV student aid programs. It is a comprehensive study that examines how undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students and their families pay for postsecondary education. Approximately 19,000 NPSAS:04 sample members were confirmed as first-time beginning students. Interviews were then conducted three times: in 2004, at the end of their first year in postsecondary education; in 2006, about 3 years after their initial college entry; and in 2009, about 6 years after they first enrolled. Through student interviews and other sources, data on students' demographic characteristics; their persistence in and completion of postsecondary education programs; their transition into employment; and changes over time in their goals, marital status, income, and debt, among other indicators, were collected. The final BPS:04/09 dataset contains information on approximately 16,700 students. In 2009, BPS:04/09 also collected transcript data from every institution that BPS students attended between July 2003 and June 2009. About 91 percent of the eligible students had at least one transcript available for analysis. The transcripts provide a detailed portrait of students' enrollment, coursetaking, credit accumulation, academic performance, and degree histories. More information about BPS:04/09 and its transcript component can be found in appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "To provide a longitudinal look at STEM attrition over 6 years in college, this study focused on a subsample of BPS:04/09 students who participated in the initial survey in 2003\u221204 as well as in the two follow-up surveys in 2006 and 2009. Most STEM occupations require at least an associate's degree (Carnevale, Smith, and Melton 2011); therefore, the study sample was further restricted to students who began their postsecondary education in a bachelor's or associate's degree program. 10 These selections resulted in approximately 7,800 beginning bachelor's degree students and 5,600 beginning associate's degree students to be included in the analysis of this study. 11 Because these two groups of students had different STEM attrition rates, they were analyzed separately throughout this report. For brevity, beginning bachelor's or associate's degree students are frequently referred to as bachelor's or associate's degree students in this study, although some students later transferred to a different degree program (e.g., from an associate's to a bachelor's degree program). 12"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Comparisons", "text": "All bivariate comparisons in this study were tested for statistical significance using a two-tailed Student's t statistic to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation.

Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons; consequently, some differences noted here might not be significant if a multiple comparison procedure was used. "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Readers are cautioned to keep four issues in mind when considering the findings reported here. First, this study draws upon students' reported major fields to identify STEM entrants. Because BPS:04/09 collected students' majors only at three time points and students could have had an unreported STEM major and STEM attrition could have occurred before the initial interview time 13 or between the three data collection points, the number of STEM entrants and the extent of STEM attrition may be underestimated. Second, because BPS:04/09 is a general purpose survey on postsecondary education, its questions and survey elements were not tailored to include all variables relevant to research on STEM attrition. Some data identified in the literature as potentially important to STEM attrition (e.g., institutional context, climate, and support for STEM learning, characteristics of STEM faculty, STEM-related preparation and experiences in high school, 14 and noncognitive factors such as motivation, interest, confidence, and beliefs) were not collected (Barr, Gonzalez, and Wanat 2008;Burtner 2005;Chang et al. 2011;Crisp, Nora, and Taggart 2009;Daempfle 2003;Eagan et al. 2011a;Espinosa 2011;Price 2010;Seymour and Hewitt 1997). Consequently, the multivariate analysis in this study cannot control for all factors that have been shown in prior research to be related to STEM attrition. Third, past research suggests that there are some important distinctions among STEM fields. For example, biology/life sciences often attract proportionally more female students than \"hard\" sciences like physics, engineering, and computer sciences (National Science Board 2012); attrition rates vary across STEM fields, with relatively lower rates frequently occurring among engineering majors (Shaw and Barbuti 2010); and the determinants of departure decisions may not be the same across different STEM fields (Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010;Ost 2010;Rask 2010). While it is ideal to differentiate specific STEM fields, such analysis is very limited in this study due to the small number of BPS:04/09 students entering some STEM disciplines. Finally, this study is descriptive in nature. The purpose of the multivariate analysis in the last part of this report is not to validate a theoretical model or identify causal relationships. Rather, the intention of the model is to refine bivariate analyses, and more specifically, to examine the relative strength of associations between various factors and STEM attrition, while taking into account the interrelationships of these factors, which bivariate analysis cannot easily disentangle. Hence, while the multivariate results may suggest topics for further research that might be examined with other data sources or methods appropriate for causal analysis, they do not purport to identify causes of STEM attrition.

Only business had a similar entrance rate (26 percent). Within STEM fields, biological/life sciences was the most popular field, attracting 11 percent of bachelor's degree students, while mathematics and physical sciences were the two least popular fields, with 2\u22123 percent of students entering these two fields.

Of all racial/ethnic groups, Asians left STEM fields by dropping out of college at the lowest rate (10 percent vs. 20\u221229 percent for other racial/ethnic groups). Also, proportionally fewer Asians than blacks left STEM fields by switching majors, but there was no measurable difference between Asians and their White and Hispanic counterparts in terms of leaving STEM fields by switching majors. While proportionally more students whose parents had only a high school education or less left STEM fields by dropping out of college than their counterparts whose parents earned a bachelor's or higher degree, no measurable difference by parental education was found in terms of the rate at which students switched major from a STEM to a non-STEM field. Similarly, while proportionally more students in the two lowest quarters of the income level left STEM fields by dropping out of college than their counterparts in the highest quarter of the income level, no measurable difference by income levels was observed in terms of the rate at which students switched major from a STEM to a non-STEM field. STEM attrition rates also varied by students' precollege academic preparation, as indicated by their high school grade point average (GPA) and the highest level of math course taken in high school. For example, 46 percent of STEM entrants with a high school GPA of less than 2.5 and 41 percent of those who did not take algebra II/trigonometry or higher math courses in high school left STEM fields by dropping out of college, compared with 14 percent of those with a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher and 12 percent of those who took calculus in high school (table 2).

Such differences, however, were not observed when examining the rates at which students switched majors. While STEM entrants first attending public 4-year and private nonprofit 4-year institutions had similar rates of dropping out of college (20 percent and 18 percent, respectively), proportionally more STEM entrants first attending public 4-year institutions switched majors out of STEM fields than those first attending private nonprofit 4year institutions (30 percent vs. 24 percent). Furthermore, STEM entrants who first attended for-profit 4-year institutions had a higher dropout rate (57 percent) than their counterparts who first attended public 4-year and private nonprofit 4-year institutions (20 percent and 18 percent, respectively). Finally, the percentage of Pell Grant recipients who dropped out of college was higher than that of non-Pell Grant recipients (25 vs. 18 percent). The difference in the percentage of switching majors between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients, however, was not statistically significant (30 percent and 27 percent, respectively). For associate's degree students, many apparent differences in STEM attrition rates among various groups were in similar directions as those found for bachelor's degree students, but not measurably different due to the smaller sample size of this group. The only measurable differences found were that proportionally more females switched out of STEM fields than males (43 percent vs. 29 percent) and proportionally more students whose high school GPA was lower than 2.5 dropped out of college before earning a degree or certificate (42 percent) than their counterparts whose GPA was 3.5 or higher (22 percent)."}, {"section_title": "STEM Coursetaking and Performance in Postsecondary Education", "text": "Students come to college with expectations and preferences based at least in part on their high school coursework, achievement, and parental and social influences.

These analyses, though informative, did not take into account potentially complex relationships among multiple, often related, factors. For example, the estimates presented in table 2 indicate that proportionally fewer Asian STEM entrants left STEM fields by dropping out of college without earning a degree or certificate than did students from other racial/ethnic groups. This result may be due to the fact that Asian students are often better prepared in high school mathematics than are other students (Berkner and Choy 2008). Such preparation may lead to easier access to selective institutions and higher grades in college (Radford and Horn 2012), two factors that are correlated with STEM attrition in table 2 and figure 11. Given these interrelationships, being Asian may not necessarily be associated with STEM attrition when other factors, such as the selectivity of postsecondary institutions and college-level math coursetaking, are taken into account. The following section describes the results of a multivariate analysis that introduces multiple factors simultaneously and allows for examination of how each factor is associated with STEM attrition, net of the others. In contrast to some multivariate analyses which seek to identify causal relationships, this analysis is not designed to determine the cause of STEM attrition, but rather to refine the preceding bivariate analyses by analyzing the relative strength of associations among various factors and STEM attrition, while taking into account the interactions of multiple factors."}, {"section_title": "Model Specifications", "text": "After entering a STEM field, students' possible STEM outcomes can be defined in three ways: they can persist and eventually earn a degree in a STEM field, they can switch majors and pursue a non-STEM field (whether or not they complete), or they can quit school entirely without earning a degree or certificate. In order to examine the simultaneous association of these multiple discrete outcomes with other related factors, a multinomial probit (MNP) model was used. MNP is one of the statistical techniques commonly used to predict the probability of one event occurring (such as switching majors) over several mutually exclusive alternatives (Borooah 2001;Koop 2008). The results are often presented as average marginal effects, which measure the change in the probability of observing an outcome when an independent variable changes by one unit while keeping all other variables constant in the model (Liao 1994). The following MNP analysis focuses on the two types of STEM attrition (i.e., switching majors and leaving college without a degree or certificate). Only STEM entrants were selected for this analysis. 20 The model was run separately for bachelor's and associate's degree students, and the MNP results are reported separately for each level. Many factors have been identified in the literature as potentially important to STEM attrition. These factors include (but are not limited to) demographic characteristics, precollege academic preparation, institutional context, climate and support, and coursetaking and performance. The MNP model below attempted to include as many of these factors (i.e., independent variables) as available in BPS:04/09 to examine their net associations with STEM outcomes while controlling for the interrelationships among these factors. Specifically, the MNP model included sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, and income as demographic factors. The STEM literature has reported that women, underrepresented minorities, first-generation students, and those from low-income backgrounds tend to have higher STEM attrition rates than their counterparts (Anderson and Kim 2006;Griffith 2010;Hill, Corbett, and Rose 2010;Huang, Taddese, and Walter 2000;Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010;Shaw and Barbuti 2010). These demographic characteristics also influence many aspects of college experiences, which, in turn, are associated with STEM outcomes (Berkner and Choy 2008;Chen 2009;Seymour and Hewitt 1997;Skomsvold, Radford, and Berkner 2011). For precollege academic preparation, two high school variables were included in the MNP model: GPA and the highest level of math course taken. 21 While high school GPA measures students' overall academic preparation for college, the kind of math courses taken indicates the level of math preparation students achieved in high school and is directly related to majoring and persisting in STEM fields (Haag and Collofello 2008;Huang, Taddese, and Walter 2000;Kokkelenberg and Sinha 2010). 20 A similar MNP model was also run for non-STEM entrants, and the results are presented in table B-2 in appendix B. 21 Information on high school coursetaking in mathematics was not collected for students age 24 or above (about 16 percent of the study sample). Information on high school GPA was not collected for students age 24 or above or those who had not received a high school diploma (about 21 percent of the study sample). To avoid excluding these students from the MNP analysis, missing cases for these two variables were retained in the \"skip\" category. Consequently, the MNP estimates for these two variables may not be as accurate as they would be if these variables were available for all students. Although institutional climate, support, and resources for STEM learning and faculty characteristics have also been identified as potential factors associated with STEM attrition (Blickenstaff 2005;Chang et al. 2011;Daempfle 2003;Eagan et al. 2011b;Espinosa 2011;Fouad et al. 2010;Ost 2010;Price 2010;Seymour 2001;Thompson et al. 2007), none of these variables are available in BPS:04/09. Instead, this study used the level and control of the institution students first attended and the selectivity of the initial 4-year institution as proxies for institution contextual factors for STEM learning. Finally, the amount of STEM coursework in college (especially in the first year), the type of STEM courses taken (particularly in mathematics), and how well students perform (especially performance in STEM fields relative to the performance in non-STEM fields) are figured prominently in students' decisions to leave STEM fields (Bettinger 2010;Ost 2010;Rask 2010;Seymour 2001;Seymour and Hewitt 1997;Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2011). These experiences were represented by the following variables in the MNP model: percentage of STEM credits among all credits earned in the first year, the highest math course taken in the first year of college, percentage of withdrawn/failed STEM courses in all STEM courses attempted through 2009, STEM GPA compared with non-STEM GPA in the first year and through 2009, and overall GPA through 2009. 22 Table 4 presents the results for the two types of STEM attrition among beginning bachelor's degree students-changing majors and leaving postsecondary educationcompared with the base category, \"persisting in STEM fields.\" The comparison groups are denoted by italics; for example, White students comprise the comparison group for race/ethnicity, which is referenced when discussing the results for students in other racial/ethnic groups. 22 To avoid multicollinearity problems, variables that had high correlations with other variables in the model were excluded from the MNP analysis. For example, the percentage of withdrawn/failed STEM courses out of all STEM courses attempted in the first year was not included because it had a high correlation with the percentage of withdrawn/failed STEM courses out of all STEM courses attempted through 2009 (e.g., 0.69 among beginning associate's STEM entrants). Multicollinearity may increase the standard errors of the regression coefficients for those highly correlated variables; consequently, significant coefficients may become nonsignificant or the sign of coefficients may change (Cohen and Cohen 1983).

In this table, for-profit 4-year institutions are included in the category of \"minimally selective/open admission.\" 9 Precollege-level math courses are courses designed to provide students with the background and foundation skills necessary to succeed in college-level math courses. Typical precollege level math courses include arithmetic, beginning or intermediate algebra, plane geometry, and developmental/remedial math. Introductory math courses are initial or entry-level college math courses that represent essential prerequisites for students who need to progress to advanced math courses and students whose degrees require an introduction to more rigorous mathematics. These courses are commonly referred to as \"gatekeeper\" or \"gateway\" courses. See appendix D for a detailed listing of math courses in each level. 10 \"About the same or higher\" means that STEM and non-STEM GPAs are the same or different by less than 0.5 point or STEM GPA is higher than non-STEM GPA by at least 0.5 point. NOTE: F-test for the overall MNP model for STEM entrants among beginning bachelor's degree students is 7.89 (p<0.001). STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) includes mathematics, physical sciences, biological/life sciences, engineering/engineering technologies, science technologies, and computer/information sciences. To determine whether a given independent variable was associated with a statistically significant change in students' predicted probability of STEM attrition, two analyses were performed. First, MNP was used to identify variables that demonstrated a statistically significant association with the likelihood of attrition. Then, for each statistically significant association identified by MNP, the average marginal effect (AME) of the variable on the predicted probability of STEM attrition was calculated. The AME represents the average percentage point change in the predicted probability of STEM attrition associated with a one unit change in an independent variable, net of other variables in the model. To provide an easier interpretation of the results, the table also presents the average predicted probability (APP) of leaving STEM fields for each group of students. APP represents the adjusted probability after controlling for the covariation among all the independent variables listed in the table. A significant AME (indicated by an asterisk) suggests that the observed change in the predicted probability is significantly different from zero. For example, the MNP model for bachelor's degree students shows that the AME of being female on college departure was significant with a value of \"-0.05.\" This means that female STEM entrants had a lower probability of leaving college without a degree or certificate than their male counterparts, or more specifically, the average predicted probability of dropping out of college for female STEM entrants (i.e., 15 percent) was 5 percentage points lower than that for male students (i.e., 20 percent) while keeping all other variables in the model constant."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Bachelor's Degree Students", "text": "The F-test of the overall MNP model for STEM entrants among bachelor's degree students was significant (F=7.89, p < 0.001), indicating that one or more independent variables included in the model were associated with one or both types of STEM attrition above what would be expected by chance (table 4). Leaving STEM Fields by Switching Majors. The amount of STEM coursetaking in the first year, the type of math courses taken in the first year, and performance in STEM coursework were among the most important factors associated with the outcome of leaving STEM fields by switching majors. Specifically, STEM entrants with lower STEM credit loads in the first year (i.e., less than 25 percent of total credits earned in STEM fields) experienced a higher probability of switching majors than those with larger STEM credit loads in the first year (i.e., 50 percent or more of total credits earned in STEM fields) (39 percent vs. 18 percent). Compared with students who took calculus or advanced math courses in the first year of college, those who took introductory math courses had a higher probability of switching majors (31 percent vs. 23 percent). The level of withdrawn/failed STEM courses was another significant factor: STEM entrants who withdrew or failed at least 10 percent of their STEM courses during their college enrollment (as opposed to less than 10 percent) had a higher probability of switching to non-STEM majors (34 percent vs. 25 percent). The probability of switching majors was also higher among students whose STEM grades were lower than their non-STEM grades (by 0.5 to 0.9 points), compared with those whose STEM grades were equal to or higher than their non-STEM grades (31 percent vs. 24 percent). Unlike the results of the bivariate analysis, none of the demographic characteristics were significantly associated with switching from a STEM to non-STEM major. More specifically, being female or being Asian-two significant factors related to switching majors in the bivariate analysis-were no longer significant after controlling for other factors in the MNP analysis. The type of first institution, however, continued to be significant: STEM entrants who first attended public 4-year institutions had a higher probability of switching majors than their counterparts who first attended private nonprofit 4-year institutions (30 percent vs. 21 percent) and for-profit 4-year institutions (30 percent vs. 8 percent), even after controlling for demographic characteristics, precollege academic preparation, and STEM coursetaking and performance, Students' overall college GPA was negatively associated with switching majors after controlling for other factors in the model. The probability of switching majors was higher among STEM entrants with an overall college GPA of 3.5 or higher (35 percent) than among those who earned a GPA of less than 3.0 (17\u221225 percent). Further, those who took calculus in high school also appeared to have a higher probability of switching majors than those who took no mathematics beyond algebra II or trigonometry in high school (25 percent vs. 11 percent). These seemingly counterintuitive patterns suggest that all other factors being equal, high-performing students or academically strong students may be more prone to leave STEM fields by switching majors than low-performing or academically weak students, who were more likely to leave STEM fields by leaving college, as shown below. Leaving College Without Earning a Degree or Certificate. Several groups of STEM entrants had a higher probability of exiting STEM fields by leaving college all together without earning a degree or certificate. Compared with their counterparts, STEM entrants who were male, from low-income backgrounds, and who first attended the least selective institutions had a higher probability of leaving STEM fields by dropping out of college. Low college performance as well as poor progress in STEM coursework also appeared to be important factors: earning an overall GPA of less than 3.0 (versus a GPA of 3.5 or higher) and withdrawing from or failing at least 10 percent of STEM courses attempted through 2009 (vs. less than 10 percent) were associated with an increased probability of leaving STEM fields by exiting college without earning a degree or certification. 23"}, {"section_title": "Beginning Associate's Degree Students", "text": "Leaving STEM Fields by Switching Majors.

The main findings for associate's degree students were largely similar to those for bachelor's degree students; that is, among all factors included in the model, the amount of STEM coursetaking in the first year, the type of math courses taken in the first year, and performance in STEM courses were among the most important factors. Specifically, STEM entrants who had lower STEM credit loads in the first year, took precollege-level or introductory math courses in the first year, earned STEM grades that were lower than non-STEM grades (by 0.5 to 0.9 points) had a higher probability of switching majors than their counterparts who had higher STEM credits loads in the first year (43 percent vs. 32 percent), took advanced math courses in the first year (35\u221236 percent vs. 19 percent), and whose STEM grades were equal to or higher than their non-STEM grades (39 percent vs. 30 percent). While the bivariate analysis found that females switched from STEM to non-STEM majors more frequently than males at both the bachelor's and associate's degree levels (as seen in table 2), this finding held only for associate's degree students in the multivariate analysis: after controlling for the other variables in the model, female STEM entrants had a higher probability of switching majors (16 percentage points higher) than their male counterparts, with the average predicted probability of 43 percent for females compared with that of 27 percent for males. Income was another significant factor for associate's degree students: STEM entrants from low-income backgrounds had a lower probability of leaving STEM fields by switching majors (19 percent) than their counterparts from high-income backgrounds (39 percent). Students' overall college GPA followed a similar pattern seen for bachelor's degree students; their college GPA was negatively associated with switching majors after controlling for other factors in the model. The probability of leaving STEM fields by switching majors was 39 percent for STEM entrants with an overall college GPA of 3.5 or higher and 19 percent for those with an overall GPA of less than 2.5. However, the relationship was reversed when looking at high school GPA: those who earned a high school GPA of less than 2.5 had a higher probability of switching majors than their counterparts with a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher (37 percent vs. 24 percent). It should be noted that the direction of the negative association between college GPA and switching majors is not known. The analysis could not determine whether students with higher college GPAs were more prone to switch majors or whether their higher GPA was a result of switching to a non-STEM field in which earning high grades may be relatively easier than in STEM fields. 24 Leaving College Without Earning a Degree or Certificate. Only performance measures (overall and in STEM fields) emerged as significant factors associated with exiting STEM fields by leaving college altogether at the associate's degree level: STEM entrants who earned an overall college GPA of less than 2.5 (vs. a GPA of 3.5 or higher), who earned a GPA in STEM courses that was at least one grade point below their non-STEM GPA (vs. a STEM GPA that was similar to or higher than their non-STEM GPA), or who had withdrawn or failed to complete at least 10 percent of STEM courses during their college career (as opposed to less than 10 percent) experienced an increased probability of leaving STEM fields via college departure."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Rising concern about America's ability to maintain its competitive position in the global economy has prompted calls for the U.S. higher education system to produce more graduates with training and expertise in STEM fields (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology 2012). To attain this goal, policymakers recommend reducing STEM attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in STEM fields in college is one way to expand the pool of STEM professionals that the nation needs to advance economically and be globally competitive. Within this context, this study presents an examination of students' attrition from STEM fields over 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). Based on students' reported major fields at the three points in time (2004, 2006, and 2009) when BPS:04/09 data were collected, 28 percent of bachelor's degree students and 20 percent of associate's degree students chose a STEM major field at some point during their postsecondary enrollment from 2003 to 2009. Many of these STEM entrants-48 percent at the bachelor's degree level and 69 percent at the associate's degree level-exited STEM fields several years later by changing majors or leaving college without completing a degree or certificate. Attrition rates of this magnitude are not unique to STEM fields. At the bachelor's degree level, fields like humanities, education, and health sciences experienced higher attrition rates (56\u221262 percent) than did STEM fields (48 percent), and business and social/behavioral sciences experienced attrition rates of similar magnitude (50 percent and 45 percent, respectively) as those in STEM fields. At the associate's degree level, the attrition rates in non-STEM fields ranged from 57 percent in health sciences and 66 percent in business to 70 percent in education and 72 percent in humanities, compared with 69 percent in STEM fields. This report focused on identifying the characteristics associated with STEM attrition. Bivariate analyses showed that STEM attrition was correlated with a wide range of factors, including students' demographic backgrounds, precollege academic preparation, postsecondary enrollment characteristics, and STEM coursetaking and performance. When the study was subjected to a more rigorous multivariate analysis, the findings of the MNP models on STEM attrition yielded more information than was possible to obtain from bivariate analysis. While bivariate results show that STEM coursetaking and performance was correlated with switching majors to non-STEM fields, the MNP results revealed that taking lighter credit loads in STEM courses in the first year, taking less challenging math courses in the first year, and earning STEM grades that were lower than non-STEM grades were associated with a higher probability of switching majors for STEM entrants at both the bachelor's and associate's degree level after controlling for many factors in the model. Accumulating high levels of withdrawn/failed STEM credits over time was also a significant factor in the probability of bachelor's degree students switching majors. The MNP results also revealed that exiting STEM fields by leaving college altogether without earning a degree or certificate was more importantly associated with students' overall college performance and their success in STEM courses than many other factors. Poor performance in college (as reflected by a lower cumulative GPA through 2009) and high levels of withdrawn/failed STEM courses were associated with a higher probability of dropping out of college for STEM entrants at both the bachelor's and associate's degree levels. Lower STEM grades relative to non-STEM grades was also associated with an increased probability of dropping out of college for STEM entrants at the associate's degree level. The MNP analysis also illuminated several other patterns that were different from those in the bivariate results. While the bivariate analysis found that female STEM entrants among both bachelor's and associate's degree students left STEM fields more frequently by switching majors than their male counterparts, the MNP analysis revealed this pattern only among associate's degree students. In addition, the bivariate analysis showed that at the associate's degree level, students from low-or high-income backgrounds had similar rates of leaving STEM fields by switching majors; after controlling for the other variables in the MNP model, however, students from low-income backgrounds were found to have a lower probability of switching majors than those from high-income backgrounds (19 percent vs. 39 percent). The MNP results further indicated that low-and high-performing STEM entrants may exit STEM fields in different ways. The probability of exiting STEM fields by dropping out of college was higher for low-performing students (i.e., those with an overall college GPA of less than 2.5) than for high-performing students (i.e., those with an overall college GPA of 3.5 or higher), while the probability of leaving STEM fields by switching majors was higher for students in the high-performing group than for their peers in the low-performing group. This finding was consistent for both bachelor's and associate's degree students. The direction of the negative association between college GPA and switching majors cannot be determined from the analysis. That is, whether high-performing students were more prone to switch majors than low-performing students or whether it was easier for STEM leavers to earn higher grades after switching to a non-STEM field cannot be determined from the data. Nevertheless, the loss of high-performing students from STEM fields has been reported in other studies (Bettinger 2010;Lowell et al. 2009). Some have found that high-performing students abandoned STEM majors for certain non-STEM fields that offer higher earnings (e.g., business and health care) (Bettinger 2010;Shaw and Barbuti 2010). More research is needed to understand the underlying motivation for changing majors, particularly among top students. Finally, the MNP analysis confirmed several patterns observed among bachelor's degree STEM entrants in the bivariate analysis. All other factors being equal, bachelor's degree STEM entrants who first attended public 4-year institutions had a higher probability of switching majors than those who started at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. Bachelor's degree STEM entrants who were male, came from low-income backgrounds, or first attended the least selective institutions had a higher probability of dropping out of college than their corresponding counterparts who were female, came from high-income backgrounds, or first attended highly selective institutions.

Differences between estimates were tested against the probability of a Type I error 26 or significance level.

Student's t values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: There are some hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in estimates but also to the number of respondents in the 26 A Type I error occurs when one concludes that a difference observed in a sample reflects a true difference in the population from which the sample was drawn, when no such difference is present. specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large (and thus possibly statistically significant) t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of this type of error using a value denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 was selected for findings in this report and ensures that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced when there was no actual difference between the quantities in the underlying population no more than 1 time out of 20. When analysts test hypotheses that show alpha values at the .05 level or smaller, they reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two estimates.

In contrast to some regression analyses that seek to validate a particular model or identify causal relationships between one or more independent variables and an outcome of interest, this analysis was undertaken to identify the residual association of a variable with STEM attrition net of other potentially important student and institutional characteristics. MNP is chosen because the outcome of interest has multiple discrete categories. MNP is one of the most common statistical techniques used to predict the probability of an event that would occur or the probability of a respondent choosing a certain outcome out of several mutually exclusive alternatives 27 (Borooah 2001;Koop 2008). Assuming that each individual faces a set of outcomes, an MNP model formulation may be written as follows: xi\uf7b4 is a vector of independent variables that may be associated with or influence an individual's outcome or choice; 27 This report uses a probit rather than a logit model because probit models do not require an assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). IIA implies that the preferences between alternatives A and B depend only on the individual preferences between A and B. In other words, if A is preferred to B out of the choice set {A,B}, then introducing a third alternative C and thus expanding the choice set to {A,B,C}, must not change the preferences between A and B (i.e., A is still preferred to B after the inclusion of C). A MNP model relaxes this requirement and allows more flexibility in which outcomes are considered in the analysis. and the error term, 's, are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. MNP assumes that each individual chooses the option yielding the highest utility of all alternatives. That is, an individual i chooses the outcome j if the outcome * where for a probit analysis, F represents a cumulative probability function based on the normal distribution. Only M\u22121 of the probabilities can be freely specified because the probability for all alternatives sum to one (i.e., p(yi = 1) + p(yi = 2) +\u2026 + p(yi = M) = 1). The parameters of MNP models are generally not directly interpretable. Instead, researchers often rely on marginal effects (ME) to interpret MNP results (Liao 1994). An ME measures the change in the probability that alternative j is the outcome when one of the independent variables changes by one unit. For a categorical variable, the ME measures the change in the probability of the outcome that would occur if this categorical variable changes from 0 (reference category) to 1 (category of interest), holding all other independent variables constant. For a continuous independent variable, the ME measures the instantaneous rate of change, which typically depends on the position or value of the continuous variable. In this case, the average ME, which is the mean value of MEs corresponding to all values of this continuous independent variable, is recommended to use. The MNP analysis in this study mainly focuses on STEM attrition, examining the probability of STEM entrants switching to non-STEM fields or leaving college without earning a degree or certificate as opposed to completing or persisting in STEM fields. Because the way that STEM entrants left their fields may be different from that for non-STEM entrants, this study also ran a similar MNP model for non-STEM entrants, examining their probability of leaving college without earning a degree or certificate as opposed to completing or persisting in postsecondary education. While it is impossible to compare these two models directly, the second model provides a large context regarding the factors associated with students leaving college without earning a degree or certificate. Table B-2 presents the MNP results for non-STEM entrants leaving postsecondary education without a degree or certificate. The base category is \"persisting in postsecondary education\" (i.e., either attaining a degree or certificate or still enrolling in postsecondary education as of 2009). The analysis was conducted separately for bachelor's and associate's degree students. items coming directly from an interview and the data source(s) used to create the variable."}, {"section_title": "MNP Analysis for Non-STEM Entrants Leaving Postsecondary Education Without a Degree or Certificate", "text": "With PowerStats, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report.
