[{"section_title": "", "text": "b r i e f co m m u n i c at i o n s CD33, also known as Siglec-3, is a 67-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on the surface of myeloid progenitor cells, mature monocytes and macrophages. It functions as a lectin, a carbohydratebinding protein, and it contains putative immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibitory motifs that are typically inhibitors of cellular activity. In support of this putative function, CD33 has been shown to constitutively repress monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines 10 .\nTo explore the functional consequences of the CD33 locus, we accessed genotyped, archived samples from the Brigham and Women's Hospital PhenoGenetic Project (Supplementary Table 1a ). In these 32 young subjects, we found a sevenfold increase in CD33 cell surface expression when comparing circulating monocytes of subjects with the rs3865444 CC risk genotype to those of subjects with the rs3865444 AA protective genotype (t 31 = 8.48, P = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ). The frequency of CD33 + monocytes did not vary in relation to rs3865444 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The rs3865444 C risk allele accounted for 72.8% of the variance in CD33 cell surface expression level. We replicated this result in an independent set of 19 young subjects from the PhenoGenetic Project (t 18 = 6.29, P = 6.3 \u00d7 10 -6 ), and a joint analysis of both sets of subjects was highly significant (t 50 = 10.06, P joint = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -13 ; Fig. 1a) . Given that Alzheimer's disease manifests primarily in older individuals and that immune system function changes substantially with age, we performed an additional replication analysis using 175 older subjects, both with and without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, from three prospective cohort studies of aging: the Memory and Aging Project (MAP, n = 60) 11 , the Religious Orders Study (ROS, n = 91) 12 and the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP, n = 24) 13 (Supplementary Table 1b ). We again found that higher expression of CD33 was associated with rs3865444 C (z = 10.13, P = 4.1 \u00d7 10 -24 ) after CD33 Alzheimer's disease locus: altered monocyte function and amyloid biology\nIn our functional dissection of the CD33 Alzheimer's disease susceptibility locus, we found that the rs3865444 C risk allele was associated with greater cell surface expression of CD33 in the monocytes (t 50 = 10.06, P joint = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -13 ) of young and older individuals. It was also associated with diminished internalization of amyloid-\u03b2 42 peptide, accumulation of neuritic amyloid pathology and fibrillar amyloid on in vivo imaging, and increased numbers of activated human microglia. A\u03b2(42) uptake npg b r i e f co m m u n i c at i o n s expression in monocytes statistically mediated some of the effect of the risk allele on neuropathologic traits. We found that the effect size of the relation of rs3865444 C to neuritic amyloid plaque burden was diminished by 10% and was no longer significant (z = 1.74, P = 0.08) when we added a covariate for the level of CD33 expression to the model. Thus, these two prospectively collected autopsy cohorts support a role for monocytes in mediating some of the functional consequences of rs3865444 C that ultimately result in the accumulation of amyloid pathology and Alzheimer's disease.\nTo further explore the role of CD33 in the brains of older subjects, we examined tissue sections from MAP subjects and found that CD33 was expressed in cells that had the morphologic attributes of microglia and macrophages (Fig. 3a-c) . The CD33-expressing cells were found in the vicinity of neuritic plaques (Fig. 3a) .\nIn older age, activated myeloid cells, such as those that express CD33, are seen in the brains of cognitively non-impaired and demented individuals 16 . In ROS and MAP subjects, we found that the mean proportion of terminally activated microglia/macrophage (stage III microglia or macrophage) was significantly elevated relative to rs3865444 C (z = 3.06, P = 0.003) in the inferior temporal lobe (which is an early target of Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid neuropathology; Fig. 3d) , and there was a suggestion that it was elevated in the posterior putamen region (z = 2.42, P = 0.017) after accounting for the testing of four hypotheses ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 5a ). These associations remained after adjusting for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table 5b ). This observation is consistent with a model of Alzheimer's disease association in which monocytes from subjects with the risk allele are less able to uptake A\u03b2(42), which could lead to an accumulation of activated, but less functional, microglia and macrophage in the brain, where they fail to clear amyloid \u03b2 plaques.\nWe sought to characterize the functional consequences of the CD33 Alzheimer's disease susceptibility locus in early and late life. Our results are consistent with a recent report that decreasing CD33 expression in mice leads to enhanced A\u03b2(42) uptake by macrophage/microglia and decreased accumulation of brain amyloid in a mouse model 9 . CD33 is thought to be an inhibitory lectin, and increased cell surface expression of CD33 as a result of the risk allele could lead to downregulation of myeloid cell activity, such as the reduced uptake of A\u03b2(42). Such alterations of myeloid function throughout life could lead to the earlier accumulation of fibrillar amyloid, as measured by PiB imaging in older brains, and, ultimately, the accumulation of more neuritic amyloid pathology and a greater likelihood of meeting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease on neuropathologic examination.\nWe observed the functional consequences of this variant in younger and presymptomatic older subjects, suggesting that the CD33 risk adjusting for age, sex and batch effect (Fig. 1b) ; here, rs3865444 C accounted for 70.4% of the variance in CD33 cell surface expression. We found no significant interaction with Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in the ROS and MAP subjects (z = -0.80, P = 0.43) in whom this phenotype was available. Thus, the relation of genotype and CD33 expression appears to hold throughout life, and the effect of this susceptibility allele may be involved in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. We did not find an effect of age on CD33 surface expression.\nGiven that myeloid cells such as infiltrating macrophages or microglia are thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease by phagocytosis of amyloid \u03b2, which accumulates in neuritic amyloid plaques (a neuropathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease 14 ) , we tested the hypothesis that monocytes from subjects with the rs3865444 C CD33 risk allele have a reduced state of activation, and therefore a reduced phagocytic ability, compared with subjects with the protective allele. We found reduced uptake in circulating monocytes bearing the rs3865444 C risk allele of both fluorescently labeled dextran (t 29 = 3.33, P = 0.003; Fig. 1c ) and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2(42), t 31 = 3.64, P = 0.001; Fig. 1d ). We replicated this observation in an independent set of subjects (t 128 = 2.18, P = 0.03; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results suggest that the alteration in uptake may be relevant to the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology, where amyloid toxicity caused by the fibrillogenic A\u03b2(42) form of amyloid is important. Notably, we found that, although the effect of rs3865444 C was additive for CD33 expression, it may be dominant for functional traits (such as substrate uptake; Supplementary Table 2) .\nTo investigate whether these functional consequences of the CD33 risk allele could lead to alterations of amyloid biology associated with Alzheimer's disease, we examined two collections of older subjects (Supplementary Table 3a ) that underwent positron emission tomography imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), which measures an individual's burden of pathogenic fibrillar amyloid. Subjects were categorized as being PiB+ or PiB- (Fig. 2a,b) and the PiB+ subjects were more likely to develop cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease 15 . In a joint analysis of the two collections (n = 218 total), we found that rs3865444 C was associated with a greater likelihood of being PiB+ (Fig. 2c,d ) and, as with the internalization phenotype, the effect of rs3865444 C appears to fit a dominant model (\u03c7 2 (1) = 5.52, P = 0.02) better than an additive model (\u03c7 2 (1) = 2.78, P = 0.1). The association held if we used the PiB burden as a quantitative trait (dominant model: z = 2.35, P = 0.02) in secondary analyses. Notably, the magnitude and direction of the association linking rs3865444 C with being PiB+ remained when the analysis was limited to asymptomatic older subjects; however, the results were no longer significant (\u03c7 2 (1) = 2.87, P = 0.09), possibly because of the reduced sample size (Supplementary Table 3b) . Overall, these data support a role for rs3865444 C in in vivo amyloid accumulation in the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease.\nWe then assessed the role of rs3865444 C in the accumulation of neuritic amyloid plaques measured at autopsy. In ROS and MAP subjects, we found that rs3865444 C is also associated with greater neuritic amyloid plaque burden (z = 2.47, P = 0.01). Furthermore, we found that rs3865444 C is associated with a greater likelihood of a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (\u03c7 2 (1) = 6.54, P = 0.01). rs3865444 C was not associated with the burden of neurofibrillary tangles (z = 1.40, P = 0.16; Supplementary Table 4 ). Given that these analyses were performed in individuals with measurements of CD33 expression in peripheral monocytes frozen before death, we assessed whether the level of CD33 Our data are consistent with previous reports exploring the role of innate immune system dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease 14 and identify a specific molecule, CD33, that links genetic susceptibility, altered myeloid function and amyloid pathology to an early role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, our data suggest a new target with which to manipulate amyloid pathology and provide pertinent information that could be leveraged in algorithms with which to identify individuals at high risk of accumulating amyloid who are being targeted in clinical trials of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease 17, 18 . CD33 and its alteration of myeloid function may also influence responses to the antibody-mediated therapeutic approaches that are currently being tested in Alzheimer's disease 19, 20 ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper.

This work was supported by grants R01 In the ROS, MAP, CHAP and ADNI subjects, imputed dosage values were used for analyses of the rs3865444 C allele. In all four cohorts, DNA was extracted from whole blood or frozen post-mortem brain tissue. Genotype data was generated using the Affymetrix Genechip 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute's Genetic Analysis Platform or the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Both sets of data underwent the same quality control analyses in parallel using the PLINK toolkit (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/ plink/) and quality controlled genotypes were pooled. The quality control process included a principal components analysis using default parameters in EIGENSTRAT 25 to identify and remove population outliers. Imputation in ROS and MAP was performed using MACH software (version 1.0.16a) and HapMap release 22 CEU (build 36). The imputation quality score for rs3865444 is 0.9963, suggesting that the single nucleotide polymorphism is imputed with a high level of confidence.\nCells and flow cytometry analysis. PBMCs were separated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were frozen at a concentration of 1-3 \u00d7 10 7 cells ml -1 in 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich)/90% fetal calf serum (vol/vol, Atlanta Biologicals). After thawing, PBMCs were washed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBMCs were stained with antibody to human CD33 (clone AC104.3E3, Miltenyi, 1:20) or mouse IgG1 isotype (clone IS5-21F5, Miltenyi, 1:20) in PBS with 1% fetal calf serum. The monocyte gates were defined based on their distinct forward and side-scatter profile. The MFI was acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). An additive model was used in the analysis, adjusting for age and sex. Given the availability of genotyped samples in the phenogenetic cohort, the AA and CC genotype classes were over-sampled in Figure 1a , whereas the subjects shown in Figure 1b were not selected by genotype and represent a random sample of subjects from the CHAP, MAP and ROS cohorts, which are prospective cohorts of initially non-demented individuals.\nUptake assays. We tested monocyte uptake ability in circulating monocytes using two different substrates that have been deployed previously 26 . After thawing, PBMCs were washed in 10 ml PBS. Either 100,000 PBMCs per well or 50,000 purified monocytes per well were incubated with either 1 mg ml -1 FITClabeled dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) or 15 ng ml -1 HiLyte Fluor 488-labeled A\u03b2(42) (AnaSpec) in 96-well polypropylene plates in HL-1 media plus 5% human serum (vol/vol) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C or 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (vol/vol) for 30 min. Data shown is the change in MFI (delta MFI) between samples incubated at 4 \u00b0C (where uptake is blocked) and 37 \u00b0C (where uptake occurs). A dominant model was used in the analysis, adjusting for age and sex.\nPathology, immunohistochemistry and microglia quantification. Brains were removed in a standard fashion as previously described [27] [28] [29] . After weighing, each brain was cut into 1-cm coronal slabs using a Plexiglas jig. Slabs from one hemisphere, and those from the other hemisphere not designated for rapid freezing, were fixed for at least 3 d in 4% paraformaldehyde. We used defined landmarks to obtain at least two tissue blocks from each of the following regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle and inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal, hippocampus CA1/subiculum, entorhinal cortex proper, ventromedial caudate and posterior putamen. Tissue blocks were processed, embedded in paraffin, cut into either 6-or 20-\u00b5m sections, and mounted on glass slides. Neuropathologic diagnoses were made by a board-certified neuropathologist blinded to age and clinical data. Bielschowsky silver stain 6-\u00b5m sections were used to visualize neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal, temporal, parietal, entorhinal and hippocampal cortices, as previously described, for the pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 29 . A neuropathologic diagnosis of no Alzheimer's disease, low likelihood Alzheimer's disease, intermediate likelihood Alzheimer's disease or high likelihood Alzheimer's disease was given on the basis of semiquantitative estimates of neuritic plaque density as recommended by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease and a neurofibrillary tangle stage by Braak and Braak as recommended by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan criteria 30 . For analyses, the neuropathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was considered absent if NIA-Reagan diagnosis was no or low and present if intermediate or high likelihood 29 .

All blood draws, brain autopsies, experiments and data analysis were done in compliance with protocols approved by either the Partners Human Research Committees or the Rush University Institutional Review Board.\nThe Brigham and Women's Hospital PhenoGenetic Project. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from healthy control volunteers. The PhenoGenetic Project is a living tissue bank that consists of healthy subjects who are re-contactable and can therefore be recalled based on their genotype. 1,741 healthy subjects >18 years old have been recruited from the general population of Boston. They are free of chronic inflammatory, infectious and metabolic diseases. Their median age is 24, and 62.7% of subjects are women. For the CD33 expression experiments, the median age was 26.5 years (range = 20.0-50.0 years). All of the PhenoGenetic subjects used in the dextran uptake assay and 25 of the subjects used in the A\u03b2(42) uptake assay were also used in the CD33 staining assay. 67% of the subjects used in the A\u03b2(42) uptake assay were also used in the dextran uptake assay.\nROS and MAP and CHAP. Study participants were free of known dementia at enrollment, agreed to annual clinical evaluations, and signed an Anatomic Gift Act donating their brains at death. ROS enrolls Catholic priests, nuns and brothers, aged 53 or older from about 40 groups in 12 states. More than 1,150 participants have completed their baseline evaluation (87% are non-Hispanic white), and the follow-up rate of survivors and autopsy rate among the deceased both exceed 90%. MAP enrolls men and women aged 55 or older and with no evidence of dementia at baseline from assisted living facilities in the Chicago area in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University. More than 1,550 participants have completed their baseline evaluation (87% are non-Hispanic white). The follow-up rate of survivors exceeds 90% and the autopsy rate exceeds 80%. More detailed descriptions of ROS, MAP and CHAP can be found in prior publications [11] [12] [13] . The median age of subjects used in the CD33 expression experiments at sampling was 79.9 years (range = 65.8-94.8 years).\nHAB. HAB is a longitudinal study of older individuals between the ages of 65 and 85 years old. Participants were evaluated with an extensive battery of functional and neuropsychological tests. All participants had a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0, performed no worse than 1.5 s.d. units below the age-and education-corrected norm on the Logical Memory IIa subtest of the Wechsler Memory ScaleRevised 22 , and scored 26 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination 23 . Participants were excluded if previously diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition or if they scored >11 on the Geriatric Depression Scale 24 . Participants provided informed consent in accordance with protocols approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board.\nADNI. Subjects with normal cognition, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease were followed up with periodic neuropsychological testing, multiple imaging techniques and fluid biomarkers (http://www.loni. ucla.edu/ADNI/). Subjects (N = 96) with complete baseline clinical data sets were included in the current analysis, aged 55-89 years, in general good health or with stable medical problems at the time of screening, and had a study partner-caregiver able to provide an independent evaluation of the subject's cognitive, behavioral and functional status. Subjects did not have substantial neurological conditions, substantial active psychiatric disorders, or alcohol or substance abuse within 2 years of screening. All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing (assessing memory, attention, executive function, language and visuospatial function) and additional study partner questionnaires about behavior and daily functioning. All subjects had a global Clinical Dementia Rating scale 21 score of 0, 0.5 or 1. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni. ucla.edu/). For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org/.\nGenotypes. Subjects from the Brigham and Women's Hospital PhenoGenetic Project and HAB were genotyped using DNA isolated from whole blood and the iPLEX Sequenom MassARRAY platform (genotype call rate > 95%, HardyWeinberg Equilibrium P > 0.001). For each subject, an index of PiB binding in cortical regions was calculated using the dynamic data via Logan graphical modeling in a large aggregate cortical region of interest consisting of frontal, lateral parietal and temporal, and retrosplenial cortices (the FLR region). PiB retention in the FLR region is substantial in patients with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and has been used as a summary measure of PiB retention in previous studies 33, 34, 39 . 1.25 was the value used to separate PiB+ and PiB-in the HAB cohort, and 1.5 was used to delineate between PiB+ and PiB-in the ADNI cohort."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis.", "text": "Demographic information on all data sets was presented using counts and percentages for categorical variables and means and s.d. or medians and ranges (minimum-maximum) for continuous variables.

Outcomes of interest were assessed for normality and a square root or natural log transformation was performed if necessary. For analysis of functional assays with small sample size, we used Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The associations between rs3865444 C and our outcomes of interest were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for experimental batch and study group where appropriate. We evaluated the effect of outliers and possible confounding variables (for example, age, gender, education level), and adjusted for these variables in our statistical models if they changed the effect estimate associated with the predictor by >10%. In addition, to include a covariate for experimental batch in our models where appropriate, to correct for potential batch effects, we applied an Empirical Bayes priors distribution estimation framework (Combat v. 2.0) 40 , as implemented in Gene Pattern 41 using a parametric method. To correct for multiple comparisons, we performed a standard Bonferroni correction by setting the threshold of significance equal to 0.05 divided by the number of tests performed under each a priori hypothesis.
