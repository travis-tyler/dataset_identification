They are highly productive, provide habitat for several endangered species, and support important commercial fisheries (Zedler, 1993; Semlitsch and Bodie, 1998; Mitch and Gosselink, 2000; Talley, 2000) . These functions have been lost or compromised as salt marshes have been diked, drained, or developed (Simenstad and Thom, 1996; Zedler 1996) . The patterns and processes of these wetland losses can be identified using remotely sensed data. Aerial photography, which began early in the 20th century, is an especially important tool for monitoring long-term ecological changes. Not only can aerial photographs be used to quantify ecosystem changes, but they can help explore explicit linkages between ecosystem change and human resource uses that drive those changes. A record of these historical processes has recently become of greater use to managers as they seek to prevent wetland loss and restore wetlands to past conditions. In this paper we present an approach for discerning decadal-scale changes to salt marshes in Elkhorn Slough, California. We use multiple sources of historic aerial photographs from the archive of the NOAA Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (ESNERR), and automated and manual image processing techniques such as classification and change detection to establish patterns of wetland vegetation change caused by major disturbance processes occurring in the watershed.\nElkhorn Slough supports one of the largest coastal marshes in California. While Elkhorn Slough contains a state ecological reserve and a NOAA research reserve, agriculture in the watershed has increased dramatically since 1970, especially on steep slopes adjacent to pickleweed (Salicornia virginica)-dominated salt marshes. Soil eroding from farms moves downslope and leads to sedimentation along the margin of the slough, where several alluvial fans have formed that have filled marshes, mudflats, and channels, and altered the wetland plant community. The objective of this project was to map historic wetland plant communities and quantify the extent and type of salt marsh vegetation change on alluvial fans from 1971 to the present, using imagery from 1931 as a base."}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing of Pacific Coast Salt Marshes", "text": "Pacific Coast salt marshes are characterized by their small size, fragmented distribution, and complexity of herbaceous vegetation communities (Phinn et al., 1996) . As a result, monitoring these systems with remote sensing technology has been challenging, and there has been limited application of remote sensing in Pacific Coast salt marshes. In contrast, remote sensing has been used more commonly to monitor wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States (Dobson et al., 1995; Jensen et al., 1998; Kelly, 2000; Ozesmi and Bauer, 2002) . The size and relative vegetative homogeneity of most Atlantic and Gulf Coast wetlands facilitates the application of remote sensing, as they may be mapped with a minimum mapping unit of 100 m 2 , but the small size of Pacific Coast wetlands, usually less than 10 km 2 , necessitates a minimum mapping unit of less than 10 m 2 (Phinn et al., 1996) . As with other wetland ecosystems, varying tidal stages and seasonal differences on the Pacific Coast also pose challenges (Jensen et al., 1993) .\nIn order to expand the use and success of remote sensing data for mapping wetlands in the region, data requirements for discriminating scene elements in Pacific Coast marshes have been developed. Requirements include a pixel size of 0.75 to 2 m, the presence of at least two bands: red (600-680 nanometers) and NIR (750-900 nanometers), image dates of June or July, and tide levels less than +1.5 MSL (Phinn, 1997 (Phinn, , 1998 .\nSeveral types of digitally captured remote sensing imagery-multispectral and hyperspectral-have been used to map Pacific Coast wetlands. One example is the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), which used Landsat imagery to produce baseline landcover and change data for the U.S. coastal zone. In this project, imagery has been classified into 22 land cover classes that include coastal wetlands and adjacent uplands (Dobson et al., 1995) . A C-CAP change detection analysis of San Francisco Bay and Elkhorn Slough between 1986 and 1993 documented changes in urbanization and marsh extent (NOAA, 1998) . While it serves as an excellent tool for coastal resource managers, use of the 30 meter/pixel TM imagery restricted the discrimination of wetlands to four classes-palustrine emergent, estuarine emergent, unconsolidated shore, and algae-along with water.\nDigital aerial imagery such as Advanced Data Acquisition and Registration (ADAR) imagery has become increasingly popular in studies of Pacific Coast marshes, as its specifications have been found to be suitable for mapping vegetation cover types and wetland restoration monitoring (Phinn, 1998) . Because of its high spatial resolution (less than 1 m) and four spectral bands, ADAR has been successfully used to delimit patches of low, middle, and high marsh vegetation (Phinn et al., 1996) . However ADAR data is not available before 1991, limiting its use in historical monitoring.\nHyperspectral imagery at the appropriate spatial scale also shows promise in mapping Pacific Coast salt marsh species distribution. Dominant plants in a San Francisco Bay salt marsh were found to differ in water content and, as a result, could be spectrally differentiated by water absorption features as estimated from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data (Zhang et al., 1997) . Again, the AVIRIS sensor, with 224 bands and 20 m spatial resolution, proved to be moderately useful in classifying 10 vegetation classes and one mud class in the Florida Everglades, with an average accuracy of 66% (Hirano et al., 2003) . In another study, Schmidt and Skidmore (2003) used a field spectrometer to find that spectral reflectance curves of vegetation types were statistically different in Dutch marshes dominated by grasses, sedges, herbs, and rushes. Results indicated that individual species may be identified from imagery using spectral libraries obtained in the field at the time of image acquisition. Further potential exists with the high-resolution hyperspectral sensor Ocean Portable Hyperspectral Imager for Low Light Spectroscopy (PHILLS II) developed by the U.S. Navy. Images from this sensor are currently in use by CI-CORE (California State University's Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and Education) to create 2-meter resolution maps of seafloor habitat in Monterey Bay.\nThese examples demonstrate the importance of spatial and spectral resolution for mapping wetlands in a modern context. But while digital aircraft imagery such as ADAR provides high spatial resolution required to map plant communities and Landsat MSS can provide historical data dating to 1972, only color or color IR aerial photography provides the spatial and spectral resolution and temporal scale required to conduct long-term historic time series analysis of wetland change at the plant community level.\nBecause of its widespread capture and spatial resolution, aerial photography has been the most commonly used data source for mapping and inventorying wetlands nationwide (Lee and Lunetta, 1995; Barrette et al., 2000) and was used to develop the first nationwide wetlands mapping product, produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Project (Service, 2004) . Aerial photography allows for identification of more types of wetlands, including those that are small or long and narrow, compared to satellite imagery, which is unable to detect these features. Because of these advantages, aerial photography is preferred for detailed wetland mapping, especially if the goal is to map different vegetation types (Ozesmi and Bauer, 2002) .\nSeveral studies have shown the value of aerial photography over satellite imagery for certain mapping needs (Lee and Lunetta, 1995) . For example, color IR photographs are useful for estimating percentage vegetation cover in salt marshes (Shuman and Ambrose, 2003) . Compared to multispectral SPOT imagery, manual interpretation of aerial photography produced much greater accuracy levels when mapping vegetation in the Florida Everglades (Rutchey and Vilchek, 1999) . In addition, high resolution (1 m) color IR photography was more successful than Landsat TM when classifying complex wetland environments in southern Louisiana; comparison between the two data sources showed that spatial resolution of the sensor was the most important factor in separating classes for this type of wetland (Ramsey and Laine, 1997) . While most wetland mapping efforts from aerial photographs have relied on traditional manual photointerpretation methods, few have used automated classification algorithms with this imagery (e.g., Rutchey and Vilchek, 1999; Lucas et al., 2002; Shuman and Ambrose, 2003) .\nDespite the advantageous spatial resolution provided by most aerial photography, there remain challenges associated with color balance and geometric distortion due to camera tilt, relief displacement, lens distortion, and atmospheric refraction, which can cause scale variation and horizontal error (Dickert and Tuttle, 1980; Bolstad, 1992; Barrette et al., 2000) and must be rectified. Also, the acquisition of aerial photography can be prohibitively expensive in comparison to satellite imagery (Ozesmi and Bauer, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Historical Ecology", "text": "Historic aerial photographs are essential tools in the developing field of historical ecology. Historical ecology is characterized by the use of a long time sequence of measurements or observations to gain information about changes in populations, ecosystem structures, disturbance frequencies, process rates, trends, and periodicities (Swetnam et al., 1999) . Applied historical ecology involves the use of historical knowledge in ecosystem management and planning. Historical information has become increasingly important in setting sustainable management goals and has become central to the field of restoration ecology, in which reference conditions are required for determining ecologically justifiable restoration goals (ibid.). The use of historical geographic data, like photographs, for mapmaking is a key component of historical ecology research, as maps most clearly illustrate the relationship between physical processes and habitats, habitats and species, and habitats of different kinds (Grossinger, 2001) . Maps also can help identify significant historical habitat types and current habitat remnants that are an important source of regional species diversity (ibid.). One excellent example of map making for historical ecology is the San Francisco EcoAtlas, a GIS product that incorporates multiple data sources to produce a historic view of San Francisco Bay wetland ecosystems circa 1800 as well as a present-day view (SFEI, 1998) (available at www.sfei.org). This product guides the development of science-based ecological goals and restoration plans for the San Francisco Bay (Goals Project, 1999) ."}, {"section_title": "The Study Area", "text": "The Elkhorn Slough watershed is situated on the coast of Monterey Bay in Monterey and San Benito Counties in California (Fig. 1) . The watershed is small (182 km 2 ) and the slough extends 11.4 km from Moss Landing on Monterey Bay to the furthest reach inland. Elkhorn Slough is a seasonal estuary surrounded by more than 1,420 ha of tidal marsh and flats (Caffrey et al., 2002) , making it one of the largest salt marsh systems in California (Dickert and Tuttle, 1985) . Steep hills rise 30 to 100 m from the marsh; while many hills are cultivated, the uplands are also characterized by oak woodland, grassland, and maritime chaparral communities.\nThe Elkhorn Slough region has a Mediterranean climate, with a monthly mean temperature range of 11.1\u00b0 to 15.4\u00b0C and an average annual rainfall of 55.3 cm that Fig. 1 . The Elkhorn Slough study area and study sites. Fifteen sediment fans were studied in this project. Circles represent fans below active farming, squares represent fans below catchments with land taken out of cultivation and restored in the mid 1990s, and triangles represent fans below grazed areas.\ngenerally occurs between October and May (Caffrey et al., 2002) . A majority of the soils in the watershed uplands are derived from the Aromas sands formation, an aeolian sandy parent material, producing soils with high sand content that are highly erodible when disturbed. The major soil series present in the hills adjacent to the slough are Arnold loamy sand, Santa Ynez sandy loam, and Elkhorn sandy loam. The marsh soil type is Alviso sandy clay loam (USDA-NRCS, 2004a) .\nFarming on the plateau west and north of Elkhorn Slough began in the late 1880s with establishment of potatoes and sugar beets (ABA Consultants, 1989) . Irrigation began in the 1930s with the introduction of artichokes, and strawberries became an important local crop in the early 1950s. The strawberry market collapsed in the mid 1950s but became important again in the 1970s (ibid.). According to earlier interpretations of aerial photographs, the rate of land use change in most subwatersheds within Elkhorn Slough accelerated more between 1971 and 1980 than between 1931 and 1980, indicating that increased farming intensity began in the 1970s (Dickert and Tuttle, 1980) . Between 1981 and 1993, crop acreage in the watershed increased 29%, with strawberry acreage increasing 53% (USDA-SCS, 1994). Currently, 24% of the Elkhorn Slough watershed is intensively farmed (Caffrey et al., 2002) .\nIntensified farming in the Elkhorn Slough watershed has greatly increased soil erosion rates (Caffrey et al., 2002) . Strawberry farming contributes most to this phenomenon. In the early 1980s, three-fourths of soil erosion in the Elkhorn Slough watershed was attributed to human activity and three-fourths of this erosion occurred on strawberry farms, many of which were found on slopes as steep as 15 to 30 percent (USDA-SCS, 1984) . While the average erosion rate on cropland in the United States is about 4.8 tons per acre (Brady and Weil, 1999) , average erosion rates on strawberry farms here have been calculated at 33 tons per acre per year (USDA-SCS, 1994). Most soil erosion on strawberry farms occurs as large volumes of water erode vegetated slopes located below fields. Seventy percent of the sediment eroding from strawberry fields comes from gullies along farm roads at the edge of these slopes (NRCS-SCS, 1984) .\nThe Dickert and Tuttle study (1980) of the Elkhorn Slough watershed examined historical land use change between 1931 and 1980 and calculated erosion rates associated with different land uses, soil types, and slopes. They found that agricultural land use was most directly correlated with high erosion and sedimentation rates. The authors identified sediment fans that had formed in the marsh at the base of slopes draining into the slough. Between 1931 and 1980 there was a fivefold increase in the number of sediment fans and a doubling of their acreage in the pickleweed marsh. By 1980, at least 30 sediment fans had formed in the salt marsh, ponds, and freshwater marsh of Elkhorn Slough."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The time between image dates chosen for historical studies, or the frequency of change detection, depends on the problem being studied (Klemas, 2001) , and influences what historical processes can be identified. Ultimately, the decision is based on the availability of imagery. The ESNERR maintains a large archive of historic aerial photographs of the Elkhorn Slough watershed that provides coverage for several years from 1931 to the present and was the source of all imagery for this project. To quantify vegetation change on sediment fans in Elkhorn Slough, imagery from four decades, starting in 1971, were classified and used in a post-classification change detection analysis. Aerial photographs from 1931 provided reference conditions for the Elkhorn Slough watershed. This frequency of change detection was chosen based on the availability of imagery and its suitability for capturing significant vegetation changes occurring as a result of disturbance from sedimentation."}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": "We chose 15 sediment fans present in salt marsh, both diked and undiked, as study areas (Fig. 1 ). All existing fans were identified and included in the study after an older map of sediment fans from the late 1970s (Dickert and Tuttle, 1980) was consulted. Also, local experts were interviewed and the perimeter of the slough was surveyed by foot in the summer of 2002. Cross-sections of the 15 targeted alluvial fans ranged in size from approximately 30 to 200 m across. Since native vegetation had recolonized the edges of some fans, we were unable to delineate their precise boundaries. As a result, the perimeter of each study site incorporated all areas surrounding a fan that may have potentially been impacted by sediment. Combined, all 15 study sites covered 37 hectares.\nTen sites were located in sub-catchments with active agriculture, three were located downhill of a cattle ranch, and two sites were located in sub-catchments where land was taken out of cultivation and restored in the mid 1990s. Four sites on the east side of the slough have severely restricted or no tidal action, whereas other sites were at least partially connected to tidal flow."}, {"section_title": "Aerial Photographs", "text": "Aerial photographs from May 1971 , April 1980 , May 1992 , and May and June 2001 (see Appendix for sources) were chosen to produce a time series of vegetation change on a decadal scale.

The 1971 and 1931 photographs were black and white, with scales of 1:20,000 and 1:19,000, respectively. The May 2001 image was a CIR digital orthoquad (DOQ) with a resolution of 0.6 meter per pixel. A June 2001 true color aerial photo with a scale of 1:12,000 was used for coverage of the far eastern extent of the slough not covered in the DOQ. The 1980 and 1992 photographs were scanned at 600 dots per inch and the 1931 and 1971 photographs were scanned at 800 dots per inch to generate digital images, all with a resolution of approximately 0.6 meter per pixel.

For each photo, approximately 30 ground control points were identified on both the DOQ and the target image, and included stable features such as railroad crossings and buildings.\nImages were resampled using the nearest neighbor function. Root mean square error for all georeferenced images was less than 0.5 pixel.

Dominant species in the bulrush/cattail class included Scirpus californicus, Typha latifolia, and T. angustifolia, with additional species including S. pungens, S. robustus, and S. microcarpus. In the black and white images, only pickleweed and mudflat areas were classified.\nArroyo willow and coast live oak were combined into one class because the overlapping variance in their spectral properties on the aerial photographs made separation through supervised or unsupervised classification unsuccessful. Several attempts were made to differentiate between them with supervised and unsupervised hierarchical methods and the use of a knowledge-based classifier with ancillary data. No method resulted in an acceptable separation of these two species, so they were combined into one class. From an ecological standpoint, this was reasonable, as our objective was to focus on changes to salt marsh vegetation, with coast live oak being highly unlikely to establish in a salt marsh. Field surveys verified that only willows had encroached into the salt marsh. Visual interpretation of the aerial photographs provided evidence that change in this forest class was predominantly due to changes in willow cover."}, {"section_title": "Classification Methods-1980, 1992, 2001", "text": "Ground-truth field data was collected in situ with a Trimble\u00a9 sub-meter accuracy global positioning system (GPS) to train data classifiers (algorithms) in order to conduct a supervised classification of the CIR images and the 2001 true color image. In addition to the IR, red, and green bands, NDVI and variance texture bands were also generated for use in the classification. Generally, the IR, green, NDVI, IR texture, and green texture bands combined produced the greatest degree of separation among classes. A hierarchical method was required to produce successful classification results.\nHierarchical classification steps included the following: (1) classification of bare soil and vegetation; (2) manual delineation of wetland and upland areas because of spectral confusion between certain upland and wetland classes; (3) upland regionsclassification of forest from non-forest, then classification of non-forested classes; (4) wetland regions-classification of pickleweed from other vegetation, then classification of other vegetation classes. Separate classification of upland and wetland regions greatly increased accuracy because the signatures for coyote brush scrubland and pickleweed were highly similar. To prevent errors of omission in the two regions, overlapping classification schemes were used for wetland and upland, with only coyote brush eliminated from the wetland classification and pickleweed from the upland classification. The habitat requirements for these species are distinctly different, making it uncommon for them to co-exist. A 5 \u00d7 5 majority filter was applied to the final classification. The majority filter removed speckle noise in the classified image; this filter size was found to produce better results than a 3 \u00d7 3 filter, while the 7 \u00d7 7 filter eliminated too much detail from the image.

The photointerpretation of these images provided by Dickert and Tuttle (1980) served as references to the on-screen digitizing. Following that, an unsupervised classification was applied to the salt marsh/tidal flat polygons to separate two classes: pickleweed salt marsh and mud flat."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment", "text": "For each classified CIR image, we generated at least 550 stratified random reference data points for use in an accuracy assessment in ERDAS 8.7 (approximately 50 points per small class and at least 100 points per large class). For the classified black and white images, at least 140 reference data points were used. Reference data were obtained from ground-truthing, photointerpretation, and other published data sources. Assessment of the accuracy of historical imagery classification is a challenge, requiring the use of multiple data sources to verify past vegetation cover (Grossinger, 2001) . To supplement our accuracy assessment of historic images, we used land cover maps from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (NOAA, 1998), photointerpretations from Dickert and Tuttle (1980) , knowledge of local experts, and data from a 1979 Draft Pre-Acquisition Planning Study for the Elkhorn Slough Estuarine Sanctuary (Madrone Associates, 1979) . We computed a standard error matrix and Kappa coefficient (Lillesand and Kiefer, 2000) for each dataset. Spatial distribution of error was assessed visually for each classified image to determine whether or not error was distributed randomly. The confusion matrices were also analyzed to determine which classes had consistently high accuracy levels among all years."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Sediment fans are not a new phenomenon in Elkhorn Slough, but analysis of historic aerial photographs indicated that their acreage and number have increased greatly since the early 1900s. In 1931, within the study areas, only 2 fans out of 15 were present. One was dominated by willows while the other was unvegetated. Both were smaller than their size in 2001. The size of the fans was estimated visually based on the presence of bare sediment or willows. In the 1971 image, fans were present in 8 out of the 15 sites. The 1971 fan areas were smaller and could be characterized by the presence of bare, unvegetated sand. Three of the 8 fans were partially vegetated by willows along the upper margin and partially covered in bare sand.\nThe overall classification accuracy and overall Kappa statistic for the five classified images were as follows: 2001: 81. 42% and 77.38%; 1992: 86.51% and 83.72%; 1980: 85.89% and 82.82%; 1971: 89.44% and 78.87%; and 1931: 89 .76% and 72.00% (Table 1) . Bare soil/mudflat was most successfully classified in the CIR images, with accuracy levels higher than 92%. Other vegetation types that were successfully classified were arroyo willow/coast live oak and pickleweed. The saltgrass/ jaumea class had relatively high accuracy for the 2001 and 1992 images, but was less accurate in the 1980 image where its coverage was limited, making little reference data available. Classification of the bulrush/cattail vegetation type was less successful, probably because this class was not dominant in the study area, also leading to few training sites. Furthermore, the photo dates did not coincide with the period of maximum biomass for cattails, which is in late summer (Jensen, 2000) . California annual grassland and coyote brush scrubland were often confused with each other; being upland species these vegetation classes were less important in the analysis of wetland vegetation change.\nThe misclassified reference data points for the 1980, 1992, and 2001 accuracy assessments were visually assessed for spatial distribution. Most misclassification error was located on edges between homogenous vegetation patches. The patch interiors were classified with much greater accuracy. Exceptions occurred when a class had a low representation in an image, producing higher error rates. Because pickleweed, bare soil, and arroyo willow/coast live oak had consistently high accuracy levels among all three CIR images, change detection results among these classes was considered more reliable.\nChanges in the area of each class from one decade to the next present some dominant trends within the study sites (Table 2 As the objective of this project was to assess vegetation change in wetlands disturbed by sedimentation, further discussion of the results will center more on classes present in the location of the historic salt marsh where sediment fans formed. Those classes with the highest level of overall accuracy from year to year were bare soil/ mudflat, arroyo willow/coast live oak, pickleweed, and saltgrass/jaumea (although this class had lower accuracy in 1980). Because of their relatively high classification accuracy and presence on the historic marsh plain, these classes will be the focus of more in-depth analysis.\nBare soil/mudflat increased by 23% (1.33 ha), with the greatest increase between 1980 and 1992 at 32% (with loss occurring between 1992 and 2001). Pickleweed cover was reduced by 32% (3.64 ha) between 1980 and 2001 on sediment fans, with the greatest reduction (38%) between 1980 and 1992 (there was some recovery between 1992 and 2001) (Table 3; Fig. 3 ). Together these classes, which as a complex (Fig. 4) . The time series image demonstrates a process of succession that was typical on five sediment fans, all of which were located on the western side of the slough where tidal action was still present. Between 1980 and 1992, as sedimentation occurred, pickleweed and mudflat were replaced by saltgrass and jaumea, in a fan-like area below upland drainages. Between 1992 and 2001, sedimentation likely continued, especially during the strong El Ni\u00f1o winter of 1997-1998, and arroyo willow took the place of saltgrass and jaumea and continued to extend into the marshplain. On the eastern side of the slough, the pattern of successional change lacked the intermediate stage of saltgrass and jaumea, but the final outcome was still an expansion of willow cover and movement of willows into the salt marsh. A breakdown of from-to changes further supports these observations of a successional pattern. Between 1980 and 2001, pickleweed lost 32% (3.64 ha) of its area within the study sites. Eighteen percent was due to conversion to mudflat while 14% was attributed to other vegetation expanding into the marsh (Table 4) . Of this vegetation shift, pickleweed was replaced most by saltgrass and jaumea between 1980 and 1992, while from 1992 to 2001 the greatest loss was due to willows. The substantial loss of saltgrass and jaumea from 1992 and 2001 was also due to willow expansion.\nThe arroyo willow/coast live oak class increased in cover 70% (4.75 ha) within the study areas; most of this increase happened between 1992 and 2001. Of this expansion, 57% occurred as willows moved into grassland and 43% as willows extended into the marsh. Between 1980 and 1992, willows replaced pickleweed, mudflat, and grassland at approximately the same rate. From 1992 to 2001, willows continued to replace pickleweed but contributed much more to the loss of saltgrass/ jaumea and annual grassland.\nOverall, the predominant effect of sedimentation was the expansion of willow into the marsh plain that occurred throughout the watershed. This pattern is illustrated There was a slight overall decrease in pickleweed between 1971 and 2001, from 8.12 ha to 7.84 ha. Mudflat increased greatly, from 3.01 ha to 7.01 ha (Fig. 6 ). By 2001, 1.61 ha of other vegetation, including willows, saltgrass and jaumea, and cattails, had invaded within the salt marsh area mapped in the 1971 image. Of this, willow cover consisted of 0.75 ha."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Use of aerial photographs in an historic change detection within a coastal salt marsh revealed patterns of vegetation change associated with sedimentation likely caused by land use between 1971 and 2001. Through analysis of imagery, the encroachment of arroyo willow into pickleweed-dominated salt marsh was documented and quantified. Use of this remote sensing method also provided evidence for a dynamic shift among wetland species in response to disturbance, with the dominant plant community transitioning from pickleweed to saltgrass and jaumea to arroyo willow in several areas where sedimentation occurred. A rich archive of photographs dating back to 1931 provided the historical context in which to interpret these changes.\nOverall, a supervised classification of color infrared aerial photographs was successful in discriminating several plant communities at the alliance level, as defined by A Manual of California Vegetation (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf, 1995) . Our study area had little heterogeneity within plant communities that were for the most part monotypic, leading to a greater success rate. The high spatial resolution (0.6 m/pixel) enhanced separability among classes and likely reduced the number of spectrally mixed pixels. This resolution allowed for the analysis of vegetation change in relatively small areas. Together, all 15 study sites comprised 37 hectares. Additional bands generated from the original IR, red, and green bands also proved necessary for a successful classification. Use of NDVI was instrumental in separating vegetation from bare soil and the IR and green variance texture bands contributed to the separation of forest from grasses and shrubs.\nHowever, some manual classification, in conjunction with the hierarchical supervised method, was required to achieve desired results. For instance, stratifying the images into wetland and upland regions dramatically increased classification success. We attempted to automate the stratification of these two regions through the use of a knowledge-based classifier and coverages such as a DEM and NWI maps, but manual on-screen digitizing generated the best results because the coverages available did not have sufficiently high resolution or accuracy.\nVegetation types most successfully classified overall were bare soil, pickleweed, and arroyo willow/coast live oak, with accuracy levels for all years greater than 82% for both producer's and user's accuracy.

Timing of the aerial photographs (April or May) also did not coincide with maximum biomass levels of cattails (late August), contributing to lower classification accuracy of the bulrush/cattail class in some years. Bulrush is present perennially on the sediment fans, but for the most part cattails dominate this class. It should be noted, however, that field surveys verify the presence of a band of cattails and bulrush between the willows and pickleweed on several sites. In the field, the width of this band varied, depending on the site, from a few meters to 25 meters and served as a transition area between arroyo willow and pickleweed salt marsh.\nChange detection of color infrared photographs revealed the stages in which pickleweed marsh is converted to an arroyo willow thicket. On five sediment fans on the west side of the slough, where tidal action is still present, successional transition from pickleweed to saltgrass and jaumea to arroyo willow occurred between 1980 and 2001. It is unknown whether one plant community facilitated the establishment of another. But probably as sedimentation occurred over the years, elevation rose until conditions were suitable for arroyo willow. Arroyo willow, unlike saltgrass and jaumea, has no salt tolerance and is adapted to coarse-textured soils as is found on the sediment fans (USDA-NRCS, 2004b) . The elevation on the fans may have increased until they were beyond the range of tidal influence and low salinity conditions could persist. Because a series of historic aerial photographs existed for Elkhorn Slough, we were able to quantify patterns of change, but more importantly, we could produce a time series that exposed an ecological process of succession from one decade to the next."}, {"section_title": "Other Historical Influences on Elkhorn Slough Salt Marshes", "text": "In Elkhorn Slough, the process of sedimentation from farmland acts upon the salt marsh ecosystem in conjunction with other pressures and disturbances as well as with restoration efforts. Sedimentation alters the margins of the salt marsh and some adjacent upland grasslands by facilitating the expansion of arroyo willow groves. At the same time, the interior of the salt marsh has been more dramatically impacted by a process of erosion and conversion to mudflat, which is most likely attributed to increased tidal amplitude and velocity that began with the opening of Moss Landing Harbor in 1947. Prior to the opening of the harbor, Elkhorn Slough joined the Salinas River, which meandered north along the shoreline and entered Monterey Bay approximately 1 km from the present-day harbor. Construction of the harbor created a new opening to the bay. It changed Elkhorn Slough from a protected, depositional system with muted tides to an erosional system characterized by stronger tidal flow and greater tidal reach (Schwartz et al., 1986) . Tidal erosion from 1946 to the present has resulted in the degradation of salt marsh, widening of tidal creeks, and increase in mudflats.\nElkhorn Slough had experienced extensive marsh loss and habitat conversion even before the harbor construction as a result of diking and draining of wetlands. In 1872 a raised embankment for the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed through the marshlands. But greater impact to the marsh occurred during the early to mid 1900s when tidal wetlands were converted to pastureland for dairy operations, salt evaporation ponds, and waterfowl habitat. Combined, these projects led to a 60% loss of salt marsh acreage by 1956 (Van Dyke and Wasson, 2004) .\nIn response to significant marsh loss, ESNERR began restoration activities in the 1980s. Various projects converted more than 200 ha of diked and drained former salt marsh to tidal lagoons and mudflats, which support diverse bird, fish, and invertebrate communities. Whereas restoration of open water habitat is relatively feasible, restoration of former salt marsh and tidal creek networks pose more of a challenge. Once drained, marshes begin to subside. Most former marshes at Elkhorn Slough have subsided approximately one-half meter (Byrd, unpubl. data) and when tidal action is returned to these lower-elevation areas, flooding generally occurs. The water depth then prevents the establishment of dominant marsh species.\nA decadal analysis of vegetation change revealed transitional stages in salt marsh habitat that otherwise would not be evident by just studying vegetation cover over two dates. Within the study areas, pickleweed cover decreased from 1931 to 2001 about 7 ha, or 53%. But as a unit, the total pickleweed and mudflat cover averaged over all 15 sites did not change greatly from 1931 levels, as some sites experienced marsh loss, but in others marsh recovery or restoration occurred. In 1931, land use on most of the east-side sites was diked pastureland. Between 1971 and 1980, some eastside sites were converted from pastureland to salt marsh as dikes and levees broke, reintroducing tidal exchange to upper marsh regions and enabling pickleweed to reestablish. In other east-side sites, restoration activities in the 1980s led to conversion of pasture to mudflat. Subsequently from 1980 to 2001 willows colonized these sites and the other sites on the west side of the slough. Freshwater marsh was also converted into salt marsh as salinity levels increased in the further reaches of the slough after the opening of Moss Landing Harbor. In summary, the pickleweed/mudflat habitat unit increased in area by 2 ha between 1931 and 1980 as a result of land use conversion and restoration, but then decreased between 1980 and 2001 by 2.3 ha as sediment fans formed, burying salt marsh. This net lack of change is not reflective of patterns of change over the entire system; our sites were only located on the upper margin of the salt marsh near the upland ecotone. However, between 1872 and 2001, more than two-thirds of Elkhorn Slough marshes were lost or degraded overall (Van Dyke and Wasson, 2004) .\nAlthough not a main objective of this project, it became evident that the postclassification change detection methods applied here were a useful tool for separating out the effects of tidal erosion and sedimentation, two contrasting processes of salt marsh loss occurring within the study areas. The from-to matrix generated by the change detection from 1980 to 2001 revealed that pickleweed within the study area declined by 32%, or 3.64 ha. Eighteen percent of the pickleweed was converted to mudflat, which can be interpreted as an impact of tidal erosion, the likely cause of pickleweed loss to mudflat (Van Dyke and Wasson, 2004) . Fourteen percent of pickleweed was converted to another vegetation class, primarily arroyo willow, saltgrass, and jaumea, and represents the establishment of new species where sedimentation occurred."}, {"section_title": "Arroyo Willow Groves in Elkhorn Slough", "text": "Arroyo willow not only expanded into the salt marsh but also into adjacent grasslands, probably establishing on newly deposited sediments from upland farms. The extent of arroyo willow was not quantified in the black and white 1931 aerial photo, but based on qualitative photointerpretation, the cover of willow riparian areas in the study areas was minimal in 1931 compared to 2001 and existed in few localized areas. One example was the presence of a willow grove at Hudson's Landing (the northern end of the slough). Another larger grove in the current day Blohm-Porter Marsh was located in the northeastern inland reach of the slough. Change detection between the 1931 and 2001 images indicated that 2 hectares of willow grove expanded into the pickleweed/mudflat complex. However, agriculture was already a dominant land use in 1931 and it is possible that some willows may have been removed prior to this time to increase pasture or farmland. Little data on willow groves exists prior to 1931, so their original extent is not well known.\nWhen the Moss Landing Harbor opened in 1947, Elkhorn Slough marshes were subjected to higher salinity levels as tidal amplitude and extent increased, bringing salt water into the inland reaches of the slough. As salinity levels increased in BlohmPorter Marsh after 1947, a large willow die-back occurred in the grove located there. Presently the willow habitat at this location is only a remnant of what existed in the early 1930s (ABA Consultants, 1989) .\nSediment fans dominated by willow groves are not a feature unique to Elkhorn Slough. Their presence has also been documented in the San Francisco EcoAtlas (SFEI, 1998). The EcoAtlas illustrates associations of large tidal flats, narrow salt marshes, beaches, and small willow groves in the historic Central San Francisco Bay. South San Francisco Bay had broader tidal marshes with brackish areas near creeks and larger willow groves (Grossinger, 2001) . Researchers found that many creeks \"did not maintain channels to the bay but instead fanned out into seasonal wetlands, especially dense, stand-alone willow groves as large as 350 acres that dotted the flatlands near the bay's edge,\" (Grossinger, 2001, p. 437) . In the past these willow groves supported a unique flora, and contributed to habitat diversity within San Francisco Bay. They have now all but disappeared (99% lost) because of development and are considered a remnant habitat. It is debated whether the groves initially formed from natural processes or from upland land use that led to erosion and depositional patterns similar to what is occurring now in Elkhorn Slough.\nThese willow groves were present in the Palo Alto area at least until 1926 when the process of their formation was described. An ecologist wrote in detail about one particular alluvial fan that formed at the mouth of San Francisquito Creek, near present-day Palo Alto, and the distribution of plant communities established there. On the alluvial fan, at the edge of the salt marsh, was a willow-composite community, consisting of arroyo willow thickets and other tree species where the water table was near the surface, with annual and perennial composites growing in the drier locations (Cooper, 1926) .\nIn historical ecological research it is important to consider changes observed during the time-period and spatial extent of a study within the context of additional land use changes over a greater time scale and a greater regional scale. Aerial photographs serve as an excellent tool for studying processes at different time and spatial scales. Historic photographs are especially useful for providing insight into how past land use activities may explain current land use and land cover patterns. The increase in arroyo willows in the Elkhorn Slough watershed between 1971 and 2001 can be attributed to upland soil erosion, but this increase must be placed within the context of past land cover changes in Elkhorn Slough as well as other regional changes. The new willow groves do increase habitat diversity and may even be said to replace willow habitat lost in the Blohm-Porter marsh when salinity levels increased after 1947. Cattails and bulrush located on the edge of many fans also increase habitat diversity within the slough. Elkhorn Slough marshes and San Francisco Bay marshes both fit into the category of Northern California salt marsh, and support similar plant communities and habitats. They are also located approximately 90 km from each other, though separated by the Coastal Range. Increased coverage of willow groves in Elkhorn Slough may possibly serve to replace a remnant habitat along with its functions that was once more widespread in a nearby region.\nConservationists in the Elkhorn Slough watershed debate the habitat value created from the spread of arroyo willow groves. But the process of sedimentation by which this species expanded continues to be detrimental to farmers, who lose productivity and acreage from soil erosion as well as to the salt marsh ecosystem, which is buried and lost as sediment builds. Resource managers at the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Monterey County Resource Conservation District are actively working with farmers to reduce soil erosion and off-farm sediment. Evidence of habitat change from sedimentation documented in this study supports the need for these continued erosion control efforts. These results may also have applications for predicting potential effects of proposed land conversions on wetland habitat."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Aerial photographs were successfully used in conjunction with contemporary classification methods to document historical changes in wetland vegetation communities. Despite the challenges associated with historic aerial photographs, such as image quality, scale, and dates of photographs, they enable the study of historic ecological processes that help explain current-day land cover. Because of their high spatial resolution, aerial photograhs can reveal processes occurring on a small scale that would not be discernible on other imagery. Analyzing several dates of aerial photographs also provides information about transitional stages of ecological processes and sequential pressures acting upon habitat loss or gain. While more advanced sensors are becoming increasingly useful for monitoring wetlands, research on historical trends requires analysis of aerial photography. Trends show that this type of historical ecology data will be increasingly called upon by resource managers who need to re-create ecological reference conditions in order to provide a basis for restoration plans and conservation goals."}]
