Concerning AD neuropathologies, extracellular amyloid plaques deposition appears the earliest, followed by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and downstream neurodegeneration events (Braak et al., 2006) . In the recent decade, the distinction between clinical symptoms and neuropathological changes became blur due to lack of neuropathological examination. Consequently, prior AD-related studies may misclassify the cognitive impairment caused by neuropsychiatric factors or cerebral vascular disease into AD (Kalaria, 2016) . In 2018, the research framework made by the National Institute on AgingAlzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) formally advised that the term AD should be defined by pathological biomarkers in vivo, rather than clinical symptoms (Jack et al., 2018) . Meanwhile, in vivo neuroimaging techniques that enable topological changes assessment has been widely used to visualize the stepwise downstream events in AD continuum (Li and Zhang, 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Perrotin et al., 2015; Stricker et al., 2016; Leijenaar et al., 2017; Mito et al., 2018) . Similarly, considering the potential subjects misclassification, re-assessing the imaging profile of AD continuum defined by biological criteria is needed.\nMyelin provides the neuronal basis of high processing speeds for high-level cognitive function (Felts et al., 1997) . On the other side, myelinated projection and association fibers are vulnerable to the negative effects of AD neuropathologies (Bartzokis, 2004) . Thus, myelin mapping is potentially an ideal biomarker monitoring progression of AD. Presently, most ADrelated studies focused on myelin of deep white matter via diffusion models. However, because of higher sensitivity to injury factors, the intracortical myelin that sustains association fibers recently receives more attention (Li and Zhang, 2015; Stricker et al., 2016) . Specifically, regions late to myelinate have fewer wraps, leading to its less protection against damage than the deep white matter tracts (Bartzokis, 2011; Landau et al., 2011) . Accordingly, at the foundation of myelin model proposed by Bartzokis, the AD-related myelin breakdown follows the myelination developmental process in reverse, roughly from the association fibers to the deep projection tracts, and from the posterior to the anterior regions (Bartzokis, 2004; Bartzokis et al., 2007) . Though clinical significant, mapping intracortical myelin in humans is still a challenge. Anatomically, crossing cortical association fibers impede the application of traditional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Phillips et al., 2016) . By contrast, recently proposed the T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1W/T2W) ratio mapping takes advantage of the evidence that myelin content tightly linked with both T1W and T2W intensity, but in opposite directions (Glasser and Van Essen, 2011) . Histopathological study showed an excellent consistency between the intracortical myelin mapping results and cortical cytoarchitectonic results (Glasser and Van Essen, 2011; Righart et al., 2017) . Also, some recent work proposed the enhanced sensitivity of detecting changes in intracortical signal intensity associated well with the disease, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and normal subject with amyloid accumulation (Granberg et al., 2017; Righart et al., 2017; Yasuno et al., 2017) . Thus, given that the T1W/T2W ratio is a clinically easy-toimplement measure, researchers regarded the technique as a parsimonious intracortical myelin marker (Du et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) .\nOn the other side, prior studies have been demonstrated that Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and gray matter (GM) atrophy are reproducible imaging biomarkers for AD continuum (Bloom, 2014; Kato et al., 2016) . As the reliable synaptic dysfunction biomarker, FDG PET study demonstrated that AD dementia patients are characterized by hypometabolism in the parieotemporal association regions, posterior cingulate (PCC), and precuneus (PCu) (Lowe et al., 2018) . Also, hypometabolism in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), PCC/PCu and hippocampus (HP) may predict the likelihood of clinical progression from MCI to AD dementia, or from normal aging to MCI (Swaab, 1991; Jones et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2018) . As for gray matter atrophy, it has applied widely in AD continuum research. Converged evidence reveal the AD damage pattern, featured as temporal and parietal cortices atrophy or thinning. In particular, HP volume is the most validated biomarkers of AD progression (Jack et al., 2004) . Emerging neuroimaging literature demonstrates the progressive HP atrophy from the AD preclinical individuals to AD dementia patients. Accordingly, to assess the sensitivity of the newly proposed T1W/T2W ratio for AD continuum depicting, considering FDG PET and gray matter atrophy results as reference are necessary.\nThe goal of our study was to detect the transformational patterns of the intracortical myelin content as AD progresses. The novelty and highlights of our investigation include that: (Braak et al., 2006) adopting the latest biological AD diagnosis criteria (Jack et al., 2018) . To our best knowledge, except the work of our research team, few neuroimaging studies focusing the AD continuum under the biological research framework (Montal et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Kalaria, 2016) and we utilized the clinically accessible T1W/T2W ratio mapping method (Glasser and Van Essen, 2011; Ganzetti et al., 2015) . Specifically, we identified 252 subjects in the AD continuum and used both the CSF and amyloid PET to determine the biological profile. To assess the sensitivity of this approach, we also analyzed the voxel-based morphometry and PET-based metabolism. Based on the myelin model of Bartzokis, regions with later myelination process would have less protection against damage factors (Bartzokis, 2004; Bartzokis et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2016) . Further, neuropathological evidence showed AD hallmark appear first in parietal and medial temporal and cortex (Braak et al., 2006) . Accordingly, we hypothesized that the earliest demyelination processes might appear in the parietal neocortical regions in AD continuum."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni. usc.edu).

Explicitly, we defined the cognitively unimpaired as subjects had CDR score of 0, MMSE between 24 and 30 (inclusive), DM \u2265 9 for subjects with \u226516 years of education; \u22655 for subjects with 8-15 years of education; and \u22653 for years of education \u22647; non-depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-15 score version <6) and non-dementia. We defined MCI as subjects preserved daily living activities, non-dementia, and objective cognitive impairment as shown on the DM and CDR score of 0.5. We defined dementia as: patients had MMSE score \u2264 26, CDR \u2265 0.5, and met the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD.\nSubsequently, we downloaded CSF dataset and identified the levels of A\u03b21-42, total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau181), which obtained using the standardized ADNI protocol as previously (Shaw et al., 2010) . Based on previous ROC analyses of the autopsy-confirmed AD cases versus the NC group, we adopted the recommended cut-off of CSF biomarkers: 192 pg/ml for A\u03b2 1\u221242 and 23 pg/ml for p-Tau 181 (De Meyer et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2010) . Although the NIA-AA research framework suggests that either CSF or amyloid PET enables to determine one's biological AD profile, in some cases, CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 might become abnormal before amyloid PET (Bateman et al., 2012; Ben Bouallegue et al., 2017) . Based on these evidence, some previous studies suggested that the combination of amyloid CSF and PET biomarker may further improve the accuracy of biological classification to some extent (Bouter et al., 2019; Spallazzi et al., 2019) . Thus, we adopted the recommended composite Florbetapir cutoff value of 1.11 (whole cerebellum as reference region) (i.e., A+ represents amyloid PET SUVR composite score > 1.11), which is equivalent to the upper 95% confidence interval above the mean of a group of young healthy controls (Landau et al., 2013) . Finally, we excluded 11 subjects with the inconsistency results of amyloid status. We also excluded FIGURE 1 | The flowchart illustrates inclusion procedures.

Next, we separately the subjected T1W and T2W images to bias correction. After correcting for the intensity non-uniformity, the T1W and T2W images were further processed to standardize their intensity by using a linear scaling procedure. After calibrating the T1W and T2W images, their ratio was calculated to generate the calibrated ratio map.

Formed by the angular gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus, the IPL highly connected with the prefrontal cortex, paralimbic cortex, and HP (Rushworth et al., 2006) . Thus, the IPL involves many advanced cognitive functions, especially in term of spatial information processing, memory retrieval, and executive dysfunctions (Lindeboom and Weinstein, 2004; Cabeza, 2008) . Also, the IPL is part of the default mode network (DMN); regions are active during rest but deactivate during external stimulation (Raichle et al., 2001 ). Due to the high processing load here, impairment of DMN would severely disturb the interconnectedness of intrinsic networks, thus is considered as the predictive biomarker for AD progression (Buckner et al., 2008) . Based on the previously published agreement between T1W/T2W maps of myelin and the probabilistic cytoarchitectonics, we interpreted the decreased ratio value FIGURE 2 | Top panel: T1W/T2W ratio change patterns in the AD continuum.

This hypothesis is alignment with the myelin model proposed by Bartzokis, suggesting that the late-myelinating regions, such as IPL, are vulnerable to a variety of insults (Bartzokis, 2004; Bartzokis et al., 2007) .\nFurthermore, we speculated AD-related pathologies accumulation and processing load shift constitute the damage to IPL (Jones et al., 2017) . Supportive evidence from our results showed that decreased IPL ratio value related to increased total tau level within patients. Even after controlling age, gender, and FIGURE 3 | Box and whisker plots illustrate the T1W/T2W ratio change dynamics in left (A) and right (B) IPL in the AD continuum. We extracted the mean ratio value from the bilateral IPL based on the difference region between controls and AD dementia. The cognitively unimpaired preclinical AD subjects had a lower T1W/T2W ratio value in the right IPL than controls (corrected). As the disease progresses, prodromal AD subjects had a lower ratio value in the bilateral IPL regions than controls. T1W/T2W, T1-weighted/T2-weighted; IPL, inferior parietal lobule; AD, Alzheimer's disease. APOE \u03b54 status, results remained mostly unchanged. Similarly, previous studies have reported that preclinical AD (amyloid positive healthy elderly) had increased Tau binding in IPL (Schultz et al., 2018) . Thus, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)-related toxicity may cause demyelination in these vulnerable regions (Bloom, 2014) . However, without histological data or Tau PET imaging, such interpretations should be made with caution. Particularly, the correlation strength between decreased IPL ratio value and total Tau level is weak. On the other hand, another possible explanation is that cognitively intact preclinical AD may shift their processing load to the posterior DMN, regions serving as the core processing hub in the brain (Jones et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2018) , to avert system failure and clinical impairment from the degenerative process. Taken together, we inferred that direct AD-related pathologies and indirect \"wear and tear effects\" might jointly contribute to the IPL demyelination (Swaab, 1991) .\nAlthough the cross-sectional study design, we hypothesized that right IPL impairment might represent an earlier demyelination process than the left during disease progression. Given that the dominant laterality of visual-related process, involving the right IPL, thus we interpreted the extra processing load to contribute to the earlier myelin loss than its opposite side (Chance, 2014) . Still, future longitudinal studies of T1W/T2W ratio mapping are needed to validate our hypothesis. After correcting the GM volume in a voxel-wise manner, the trend of decreased ratio value of IPL in prodromal AD remained. These results thus suggested that T1W/T2W ratio is a potential candidate marker of intracortical tissue integrity independent of atrophy.\nEmerging evidence demonstrated that HP is intensively involved in AD progression (Aggleton et al., 2016; Mattsson et al., 2019) . Consistently, we found prodromal AD patients (AD with MCI) had smaller bilateral HP volume than controls. Moreover, in alignment with the cascading network failure model, our results supported that posterior DMN undertook extra processing load from the stressed system vulnerable to Taurelated pathologies (Jones et al., 2016) . Thus IPL demyelination may appear earlier than HP atrophy in preclinical AD subjects (Jones et al., 2017) . However, given that HP is not a homogenous structure, thus subfield volume with higher sensitivity should be investigated in the future (Small et al., 2011) . Subsequent correlation analysis showed HP volume related with both the amyloid deposition and total Tau within patients. These correlations are supported by previous pathological evidence that the accumulation of Tau protein highly linked with each other in the temporal lobe (Marks et al., 2017) . Based on previous evidence that Tau in the medial temporal lobe strongly associated with GM volume atrophy, we thus inferred the HP atrophy in prodromal AD may attributed to NFT-related toxicity (Sepulcre et al., 2016) .\nAs the disease progresses to the final stage, we noticed AD dementia had limited T1W/T2W ratio decrease, only involving bilateral IPL and HP. However, according to previous work, AD dementia patients had widespread demyelination (Bartzokis, 2004; Phillips et al., 2016) . Thus, this result was partly opposed to our expectations. The possible reason is that AD dementia patients in our study had relatively mild disease severity (mean MMSE = 23.3 \u00b1 2.3; mean global CDR = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3). Consequently, there may still have time from the full spreading of pathologies. The interpretation supported by our VBM results that AD patients also had limited atrophy, merely involved in the bilateral temporal lobe. Also, the low specificity of T1W/T2W ratio may contribute to this result. To be specific, the amyloidrelated iron deposition in AD dementia patients may cause the T1W/T2W ratio increase and then neutralize the demyelinationrelated T1W/T2W ratio decrease (Righart et al., 2017; Yasuno et al., 2017) . In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that the regions that amyloid plaques localized with iron deposition are consistent with the AD pathological distribution pattern (Raha et al., 2013) . The subsequent correlation analysis supports our interpretations to some extent, in detail, the T1W/T2W ratio positively related to the amyloid PET SUVR in bilateral HP. Notably, the unexpected correlation results are similar to previous results (Yasuno et al., 2017) . However, it still should be noted that no correlation relationship between the IPL T1W/T2W ratio and amyloid PET SUVR was found. Given that the non-uniform distribution of myelin in the human brain, we inferred that the T1W/T2W ratio decrease in different regions might represent different pathological processes. Conclusively, future T1W/T2W studies combined with iron mapping technique and amyloid PET are urgent to validate these speculations.\nConcerning FDG PET results, our results showed that only in AD dementia, rather than preclinical and prodromal AD, had widespread hypometabolism than the control group. FDG PET thus might have higher sensitivity in assessing disease severity in the later stage than T1W/T2W ratio mapping, because restricted regions showed decreased ratio value in AD dementia patients. These results demonstrated that these two methods might have complementary advantages in depicting AD progression. The following correlation analyses showed that both the T1W/T2W ratio and FDG PET linked with global and multi-domain cognitive ability across groups, suggested that two metrics are effective imaging biomarkers reflecting clinical symptom severity of AD. Additionally, T1W/T2W ratio strongly related to FDG PET in bilateral HP regions. We thus assumed that complex pathological process, such as tracts demyelination and neuronal synergic loss, might collectively contribute to cognitive impairment in patients at the later stage of AD continuum.\nThere are several strengths of our study, including the application of strict biological AD diagnosis criteria, consideration of the potential effects of cerebral small vascular disease (WMH load matched between groups), and the inclusion of multiple levels of biological metrics, particularly the neuropathological data. Also, there existed several limitations to this study. First, due to an insufficient sample, no subjects with A + T-biomarker profile included in this study. However, previous similar AD continuum studies have reported that there are biphasic trajectory changes in cortical thickness from A-T-to A + T-until A + T + stage in cognitively intact elderly (Montal et al., 2017) . Therefore, the potential biphasic trajectory changes in ratio maps may be left out here. Second, our T2W images had coarser spatial resolution than T1W images. Therefore the possible partial volume effect (PVE) may affect the GM signal intensity (Ganzetti et al., 2014) . Future ratio mapping studies with the same isotropic spatial resolution of the T1W and T2W images is thus required. Third, although the cortical T1W/T2W ratio is a parsimonious marker for neurodegenerative disease, however, it is still clear that how accurately it represents myelin contents (Righart et al., 2017; Yasuno et al., 2017; Du et al., 2019) . Thus, it is possible that some pathological changes (iron deposition, free water or fiber density), other than demyelination, may also change T1W/T2W ratio. Future studies should combine this technique with other imaging modalities, such as neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging (NODDI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) Tariq et al., 2016) , to improve the pathological specificity."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Our study implied that the demyelination of the right IPL might represent the early AD-related abnormality in the disease continuum, showing more sensitivity than both the gray matter atrophy and hypometabolism.
