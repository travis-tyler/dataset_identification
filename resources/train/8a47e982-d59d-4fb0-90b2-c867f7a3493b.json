However, as the APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with increased cognitive decline in healthy individuals, 10 and earlier diagnosis of AD, 11 the effect of APOE \u03b54 on A\u03b2-related cognitive decline warrants further investigation over time intervals greater than 18 months.\nAnother strong genetic candidate for moderating A\u03b2-related memory decline is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. BDNF is important in the biological basis of learning and memory in animals and humans. 4, [12] [13] [14] Prospective studies show that in healthy and mild cognitive impairment groups from both the AIBL and ADNI cohorts, BDNF Met carriage is associated with faster A\u03b2-related memory decline and hippocampal atrophy over 3 years but is unrelated to A\u03b2 accumulation, [15] [16] [17] suggesting that BDNFVal66Met moderates the effects of A\u03b2 on synaptic integrity in preclinical AD. 17 To our knowledge, no study has examined the interaction between BDNF, APOE and A\u03b2-related memory decline.\nThe overarching aim of this study was to explore potential interactions between A\u03b2, APOE and BDNF on cognitive decline in 333 healthy individuals who had undergone A\u03b2 neuroimaging, genetic testing and 54-month clinical follow-up as part of the AIBL study. First, we examined whether episodic memory (EM) and other aspects of cognition would remain stable over 54 months in "}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited from the AIBL healthy adult group, the recruitment of which has been described previously. 18, 19 Briefly, exclusion criteria included the following: schizophrenia, depression (15-item Geriatric Depression Score \u2a7e 6), Parkinson's disease, symptomatic stroke, uncontrolled diabetes and alcohol use exceeding two standard drinks per day for women or four per day for men. Participants underwent medical, psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, 18-, 36-and 54-month follow-up. 19 At each assessment, a clinical review panel considered all available medical, psychiatric and neuropsychological information to classify clinical status. 19 Clinical classification was blinded to neuroimaging results.

A blood sample was taken from each participant for genotyping. The BDNFVal66Met polymorphism (rs6265) was included in a custom Illumina GoldenGate assay, which included 1536 singlenucleotide polyorphisms, and was performed by the Beijing Genomics . The development and validation of each cognitive composite score has been described previously. 23, 24 Data analysis For each composite cognitive score, three planned comparisons were constructed using repeated-measures linear mixed-effects model with maximum likelihood estimation and an unstructured covariance matrix. Linear mixed modeling was employed because of its ability to model both fixed and random effects, which accounts for multiple sources of variability in longitudinal studies. In addition, both empirical and theoretical models of AD show that once the threshold for A\u03b2 positivity is reached, there is a linear trend in cognitive decline, neurodegeneration and amyloid accumulation until a clinical diagnosis of AD is reached. 1, 2, 25 In these analyses, A\u03b2 status (\n, time, APOE \u00d7 A\u03b2 interaction, APOE \u00d7 time interaction, A\u03b2 \u00d7 time interaction and APOE \u00d7 A\u03b2 \u00d7 time interaction were entered as fixed factors; participant as a random factor; age, premorbid intelligence and anxiety levels as covariates; and cognitive composite score as the dependent variable. Within the model, the magnitude of difference from the A\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b54 \u2212 group was expressed using Cohen's d. 26 Where the planned comparisons indicated differences between group trajectories, group means (95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)) for each assessment were estimated from the model and differences in these between A\u03b2 + \u03b54 \u2212 and A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + groups at each assessment were determined by the extent of overlap between the 95% CIs associated with those means.\nTo examine the effect of BDNFVal66Met, separate linear mixed-effects models were conducted for each composite score in A\u03b2 + individuals.

No other demographic or clinical characteristics differed between groups. There was no difference in the proportion of individuals in the \u03b54 + or \u03b54 \u2212 groups who were classified as high A\u03b2 + ( Table 1) .\nEffect of A\u03b2 levels and \u03b54 on cognitive change Group mean slopes for each A\u03b2-\u03b54 group for each composite cognitive score are summarized in Table 2 . Relative to A\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b54 \u2212 , the A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + group showed a significantly faster decline on all cognitive composites, with these differences moderate to large in magnitude ( Table 1 ). The rate of verbal EM decline in the \u03b54 + BDNF Met group indicated it met criterion for clinically significant impairment within 3 years from enrolment ( Figure 2b ). In contrast, extrapolation of the rate of verbal EM decline suggested that \u03b54 + BDNF Val/Val group would meet criterion for clinically significant impairment within 10 years. Groups did not differ in the rate of decline on the executive function and attention composites (Table 3) . Finally, relative to the \u03b54 \u2212 BDNF Val/Val group, the \u03b54 \u2212 BDNF Met group did not show a significantly faster decline on any cognitive composite. DISCUSSION EM and all other aspects of cognition remained stable over 54 months in A\u03b2 \u2212 individuals, irrespective of \u03b54 status, which replicates and extends previous observations from AIBL 23, 28 and other cohorts. [29] [30] [31] The absence of any \u03b54-related cognitive decline in the current A\u03b2 \u2212 individuals is also consistent with findings of a recent study 9 and supports the hypothesis that there are no A\u03b2-independent effects of APOE on cognitive decline in healthy individuals, even when studied over more than 4 years. Compared with the A\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b54\n\u2212 group, A\u03b2 + individuals showed faster decline in EM, and this decline was increased by \u03b54 + (Figure 2a) . Recently, the exacerbation of A\u03b2-related memory decline by \u03b54 carriage in healthy individuals was shown over 1.5 years. 9 The current findings support and extend this report by demonstrating that APOE \u03b54 carriage does exacerbate A\u03b2-related cognitive decline in healthy individuals, and persists over more than 4 years. Neurologically, APOE can affect both intrinsic (for example, synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation) and extrinsic (for example, cerebrovascular disease) factors. 3, 8, 32 As all participants in the AIBL study have well-controlled risk factors for cardiovascular disease, 19 the risk of concomitant cerebrovascular events over the period of observation was reduced. Further, as there is increasing experimental evidence that APOE isoforms have a direct effect on A\u03b2 deposition, clearance and A\u03b2-mediated synaptotoxicity, 5-7 a likely explanation for the cognitive decline seen in the A\u03b2 + \u03b54\n+ group is that APOE moderates the direct effects of A\u03b2 accumulation. These results differ from previous reports, where we and others found no effect of \u03b54 carriage on A\u03b2-related cognitive decline. 23, 28, 30, 33 The most likely reason for this lack of effect was that the smaller sample sizes used in these studies resulted in reduced power to detect any effects of \u03b54 on A\u03b2-related cognitive decline. 23, 28, 30, 33 We reported previously that BDNFVal66Met moderated A\u03b2-related changes in cognition and neurodegeneration in both healthy older and mild cognitive impairment groups in AIBL and ADNI, although it did not moderate the rate of A\u03b2 deposition. [15] [16] [17] Consistent with evidence indicating that BDNF is necessary for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, 4 we proposed that BDNFVal66Met affects the clinical manifestation of early AD by influencing the ability of the brain to tolerate A\u03b2 toxicity. 16, 17 In the current study, we explored whether BDNFVal66Met moderated any relationship between A\u03b2, \u03b54 and cognition. The A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + BDNF Met group showed faster decline in EM and language compared with both the \u03b54 \u2212 BDNF Val/Val and \u03b54 \u2212 BDNF Met groups (Figure 2b) . The \u03b54 + BDNF Val/Val group showed a moderate rate of cognitive decline. Consistent with our previous observations, [15] [16] [17] BDNFVal66Met, such as APOE, did not moderate any cognitive variable in A\u03b2 \u2212 individuals.\nThese results raise some important prognostic issues in managing preclinical AD and the implications for communicating these group data to individuals. The data demonstrates clearly that the rate of cognitive decline in preclinical AD is moderated by the combination of at least two genetic loci: Table 1 ). Another way of expressing these observations is to consider the length of time between establishing an individual's A\u03b2, \u03b54 and BDNF status and a criterion for clinically significant cognitive impairment (performance o1.5 s.d. below controls, 27 dashed horizontal line in Figure 2 ). In the A\u03b2 \u2212 group, irrespective of \u03b54 status, there was no evidence of decline over 4.5 years (Figure 2a) . In contrast, extrapolation of the EM decline observed in the A\u03b2 + \u03b54\n+ group showed that clinically significant memory impairment would be met~9 years after enrolment, while the A\u03b2 + \u03b54 \u2212 group would take~27 years. Taking into consideration the additional effect of BDNF in A\u03b2 + individuals, the effect of BDNF is seen clearly in the \u03b54 + subgroup where BDNF Val/Val homozygotes would meet criteria for clinically significant impairment after~10 years (similar rate based on \u03b54 + status alone) but the accelerated rate of memory decline in the BDNF Met group meant that they met this criteria after only 3 years (Figure 2b ). Although there is some evidence in the model that even at baseline the A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + BDNF Met group performs worse than the other three groups, this difference was not statistically significant. One limitation of natural history cohorts is that the baseline performance of each individual is defined by their first visit, rather than symptom onset. As such, the data presented here can be interpreted as suggesting that the combination of A\u03b2 + , \u03b54 + and BDNF Met does accelerate cognitive decline significantly such that even at the first assessment this decline is already evident. A diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is typically made when objective evidence of clinically significant memory impairment is accompanied by individuals' acknowledgement of that impairment, usually corroborated by an informant. 27 General cognitive function and functional activities are also typically preserved. 27 Over the course of this study, relatively few healthy individuals were classified as meeting clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment/AD (Figure 1 ). This indicates that although some individuals met criteria for clinically significant impairment, these individuals, or their caregivers, had not acknowledged any problems with cognition. We have reported previously that subjective memory impairment in the AIBL healthy cohort does not predict objectively defined cognitive impairment or A\u03b2 levels. 34 Presumably, individuals with clinically significant memory decline observed here will begin to report subjective memory complaints in the future.\nAn important caveat is that as three radioligands were used to measure A\u03b2, SUVr data could not be integrated to form a single continuous measure of A\u03b2 burden. However, we found no relationship between the proportions of individuals who were high and low A\u03b2 + in the A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + and A\u03b2 + \u03b54 \u2212 groups, suggesting that the faster decline observed in A\u03b2 + \u03b54 + was not due to more advanced disease at enrolment. Second, although the large number of healthy individuals who have undergone A\u03b2 PET neuroimaging in the AIBL cohort has allowed for this report to investigate the effects of APOE and BDNF on the clinical manifestation of high A\u03b2, the resultant sample sizes remain relatively small. Further, the AIBL study is also not a representative population sample. Healthy participants in the AIBL study were highly educated, were of Caucasian backgrounds and had few existing or untreated medical, neurological or psychiatric illnesses. Participants selected for neuroimaging were also enriched for APOE \u03b54 carriers. As such, these results need to be replicated in other more representative and ethnically diverse prospective cohorts of healthy individuals. Finally, APOE and BDNF are unlikely to be the only factors that moderate the clinical manifestation of A\u03b2; rather, other co-morbidities (for example, cerebrovascular disease) and lifestyle and genetic factors will need to be considered in future work."}, {"section_title": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST", "text": "CLM is an advisor to Prana Biotechnology Ltd and a consultant to Eli Lilly.
