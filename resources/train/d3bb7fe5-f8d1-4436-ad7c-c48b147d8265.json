[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A strong local wind has been observed in Rumoi, northwestern Hokkaido, Japan. In order to investigate the wind around Rumoi, an analysis was performed using 30-year AMeDAS wind observations and numerical experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Observation results show that there is a frequent strong wind in Rumoi in comparison with other areas around Rumoi. In relation to seasonal changes in wind direction, more than 50% of the wind in summer blows from ESE, but westerly winds are frequent in winter. To clarify the mechanisms involved in producing a strong local wind in winter, we compared two events using observations and numerical experiments. One case involves a strong local wind with a speed of approximately 12 m/s in Rumoi and a weak wind of less than 5 m/s in the surrounding areas; the prevailing wind direction is ESE (03:00 on January 28, 2003). The other case is that of a strong wind over 10 m/s blowing over the entire study area (on the afternoon of March 8, 2005), with a westerly prevailing wind. The experimental results show a relatively good correspondence with those of the observation. A cross-section view demonstrates the existence of a mountain wave when the strong local wind is observed in Rumoi. The wind then passes through the valleyshaped topography, and wind speeds are accelerated in the vicinity of Rumoi, which suggests the existence of a gap wind. Additionally, a sensitivity experiment is performed by changing the land surface model without considering snow, and the wind speed over land is seen to be reduced by 2 m/s, with very little change in the wind direction."}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "Wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In the fields of mesoclimatology and microclimatology, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the distribution of meso-\u03b2 scale winds to explain the distribution of temperature and precipitation (Kawamura, 1963) . In a study conducted over a large area in Japan, Kawamura (1966 Kawamura ( , 1981 investigated the distribution of winds over central Japan and the Kanto Plain. In the above-mentioned previous studies, the surface wind distribution was estimated by the prevailing wind direction, and determined according to wind roses of the most frequent wind direction. Suzuki (1991 Suzuki ( , 1992 used ground-based observation data and focused on the wind over central Japan to clarify the response of surface wind speed and direction to the synoptic pressure gradient. In these studies, it is acknowledged that the observed wind includes both the effect of synoptic pressure gradient and that of local circulation.\nThe present study focuses on an analysis of wind speed and wind direction in the area of Rumoi, Hokkaido, Japan (Fig. 1) . Japan lies predominantly within the temperate climate zone, but the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions lie on the main transition band between temperate and subarctic climates (Kasai and Kimura, 2013) . Therefore, Hokkaido experiences a subarctic climate, and most of the region is covered with snow in winter. Kawamura (1963) investigated the surface wind distribution in Hokkaido, and classified eight types of large-scale flow patterns during winter. Winds in the area of Rumoi blow from W or ESE direction. Kato (1983) analyzed daily mean wind speed and surface pressure data using a principal component analysis to investigate the wind distribution in Hokkaido. The author suggested that W and ESE winds blew over Rumoi as the primary and third principal component, respectively. Suzuki (1994) also analyzed the surface wind over the coastal area surrounding Japan (including Rumoi); the direction of the land (sea) breeze was shown to be ESE (WNW). However, these previous studies focused on the entire area of Hokkaido or on ground observation points in the coastal area, and therefore, the distribution of the local wind in the northwestern part of Hokkaido has not yet been adequately clarified. Currently, we can analyze this in detail using the meteorological dataset of long-term multipoint observations to investigate not only the mean field, but also local events such as strong winds.\nWinds that are influenced by local topography and restricted to a range of 100 km or less are known as local winds (Defant, 1951) . In studies of local winds in Hokkaido, Kawai et al. (2008) researched the climatological characteristics of the local wind in Tokachi district. In addition, Sagawa (2004) carried out field observations and analyzed the strong wind blowing in the Suttsu region in the western part of Hokkaido, concluding that both the area of strong wind and the discontinuity line of the wind speed in Suttsu were related to the valley-shaped area. These previous studies discussed local winds using observational data and/or reanalysis data, and therefore, spatial wind distributions were not clarified. Furthermore, there are no existing studies to date analyzing wind distribution in the northwestern part of Hokkaido using meteorological models.\nNumerical simulations are performed to determine the strong local wind and its spatial distribution in the area of Rumoi. In order to adequately study the local wind, abundant meteorological data are required. However, there is only a small volume of obtainable observed data at a certain spatial resolution, and therefore it is necessary to perform additional numerical simulations to determine the spatial distribution of a number of meteorological factors. For example, Prtenjak et al. (2010) investigated the interaction of a summer frontal bora and the sea-land breeze along the northeastern Adriatic coast, and Belu\u0161i\u0107 et al. (2013) also studied the Adriatic bora wind using a numerical model simulation. In addition, Powers (2007) simulated the major Antarctic event of the May 2004 McMurdo windstorm, and Steinhoff et al. (2013) analyzed a case study of a representative summer foehn event in order to identify and explain the McMurdo Dry Valleys foehn mechanism. In Japan, Kawaguchi et al. (2010) analyzed Yamase, which is a cold, humid, northeasterly wind blowing towards the coast on the Pacific side of the Tohoku region during summer, which blows in a southerly direction in the Kitakami Basin. Furthermore, Sasaki et al. (2010) performed numerical simulations of the strong southeasterly \"Kiyokawa-dashi\" wind in Yamagata, Japan, during the summer, and reproduced it at a resolution of 1 km. Inamura et al. (2009) carried out a numerical experiment to investigate a local wind known as the Matsubori-kaze, and discussed the influence of the unique topography of Mt. Aso, Kumamoto. Similarly, Sakamoto et al. (2014) investigated the simulation and mechanism of the Matsubori-kaze.\nWeather simulation models are not exclusively used for investigations of wind speed and direction, and are also used to model other meteorological factors. Takane et al. (2013) investigated the actual conditions of mesoscale summer high temperatures recorded in the Osaka-Kyoto urban area of Japan using a numerical simulation as well as an observation network and found that a significant amount of heat was transported from the tropics at the synoptic scale and/or mesoscale and airflow also contributed to the high temperature events.\nWhen using meteorological models, it is useful to make sensitivity studies of model parameters to evaluate and understand the model accuracy and characteristics. Previous studies have investigated meteorological model sensitivity using different dataset input methods (Tatsumi et al., 2008; Akimoto and Kusaka, 2010; Zhang et al., 2012) . In addition, numerical simulations have been applied over complex terrain in order to evaluate the ability of meteorological models (Jim\u00e9nez and Dudhia, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) . Horvath et al. (2012) performed sub-kilometer dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) (Skamarock et al., 2008) and Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5) models (Grell et al., 1994) , and considered the characteristics of these models. In the present study, as the study area is covered with snow during the winter season, a sensitivity experiment is performed to evaluate the influence of the land's surface.\nThe present study has three main aims, as follows. Firstly, this study applies a statistical analysis of the wind speed and direction to the area of northwestern Hokkaido (around Rumoi). Secondly, the strong local wind in Rumoi is modeled using numerical experiments, with the aim of reproducing the observed weather conditions during data collection and to show the spatial distribution of the wind. In addition, the experimental result is then compared with a strong wind event that occurred over the entire area of Rumoi. Finally, the influence of the topography around Rumoi is discussed as being the mechanism for the strong local wind, and a sensitivity experiment is conducted to understand the change in winds in relation to a change in land surface schemes, with or without the consideration of snow.\nA statistical analysis of the wind around Rumoi is described in Chapter 2, and the methodology used to select the strong local wind event in the area is explained. The model datasets used in this study are explained and a summary of the WRF model is provided in Chapter 3. Two types of meteorological data are used, sea surface temperature (SST) and digital elevation model (DEM) data, and the numerical method used in this study is described, together with the nested domains. The two reproductive experimental results of the WRF are shown in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses the orographic wind, which is the source of the strong local wind in Rumoi, and the result of a sensitivity experiment is also shown. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of this study.\nII. Local wind around Rumoi 1. Statistical wind analysis A statistical analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the wind movement around Rumoi, and the observation datasets of the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) were used for this analysis. The observation points were Rumoi, Mashike, Haboro, Horonuka, Ishikari-Numata, Fukagawa, Tappu, Shumarinai, Horokanai, and Yagishiri (see Fig. 1 ) and the meteorological elements were the daily mean wind speed, daily maximum wind speed, and the most frequent daily wind direction. Data from the period 1981 to 2010 were used as normal values, but from Haboro the daily mean wind speed data were available only from 1981 to 1999, and the daily maximum wind speed from 1981 to 2002, due to discontinuous datasets. Figure 2 shows the mean and maximum wind speeds recorded at the observation points. The mean wind speed in Rumoi was approximately 5.0 m/s, which is the second highest recorded speed. The highest wind speed was recorded in Yagishiri (approximately 5.4 m/s) on a remote island of Hokkaido, and hence, the wind speed in Rumoi is relatively strong compared to other locations in northwestern Hokkaido. The mean wind speed at coastal locations (Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro) was higher than those in other areas. However, the speed recorded at Fukagawa was an exception, as it was strong in spite of being an inland location. The lowest wind speed was recorded at Shumarinai (approximately 1.5 m/s), and the mean wind speed of the observation points located inland (except Fukagawa), and consisting of Horonuka, IshikariNumata, Tappu, Shumarinai, and Horokanai, was less than 2 m/s. The maximum wind speed had the same tendency as that of the mean wind speed, although the maximum wind speed of Rumoi (approximately 8.7 m/s) was slightly higher than that of Yagishiri. The lowest maximum wind speed was recorded at Shumarinai, at approximately 3.6 m/s. A wind frequency analysis was then conducted to understand the frequency of the strong winds recorded at the observation points. The winds speeds were divided into intervals of 5 m/s up until the daily maximum wind speed, and Fig. 3 shows the result of the frequency distribution, where it is evident that Rumoi had the least frequency (7%) of weak winds (< 5 m/s). The weak wind (< 5 m/s) occupied more than half of the wind in Horonuka, Ishikari-Numata, Tappu, Shumarinai, and Horokanai. Rumoi recorded the second largest number of days with a maximum wind speed of more than 10 m/s, after Yagishiri. This shows that the wind in Rumoi was strong in both frequency and wind speed. In addition, there were minor frequencies of strong winds (> 20 m/s) in Rumoi (0.11%), Fukagawa (0.06%), and Yagishiri (0.68%).\nAs the above results related only to wind speed, an analysis was also performed in relation to wind direction. Wind roses were made on the basis of the daily most frequent wind direction at the observation points. Figure 4 shows the wind roses for an entire year, and during winter (DJFM) and summer (JJAS). From an analysis of the annual wind roses, it is evident that Rumoi, Horonuka, Fukagawa, Tappu, Shumarinai, and Horokanai experience two main wind directions with no seasonal changes occurring in these wind directions, even when the frequency of the wind changes. These winds are, therefore, considered to be the prevailing winds at each location. Mashike and Haboro also experience two dominant wind directions, but seasonal change exists in the wind direction frequency. IshikariNumata has three most frequent wind directions (NE, S, and NW). In addition, the wind roses of Yagishiri show various directions, and it is therefore evident that no prevailing wind direction exists at Yagishiri.\nIn relation to seasonal change, more than 50% of the wind blows from ESE in Rumoi during summer. In winter, however, the westerly wind is more frequent (at more than 30%), although the ESE wind continues to blow in Rumoi. In a previous study, Kato (1983) divided the observation points into four kinds of wind systems to clarify regional characteristics of the wind in Hokkaido, and Rumoi was then classified into clusters where the wind from the west changes seasonally. During winter in Mashike, Haboro, Tappu, Shumarinai, and Yagishiri the wind tends to blow from northward in contrast to summer, but the wind roses of Fukagawa and Horokanai rarely change seasonally. "}, {"section_title": "Selection of events", "text": "This subsection describes the methodology used to select strong local wind events around Rumoi. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , Rumoi has a wind speed higher than the surrounding AMeDAS observation points, and strong winds blow frequently (except for Yagishiri, which is located on a remote island). It is evident from results of analysis of the most frequent wind direction in Rumoi (Fig. 4a) , that the two main wind directions are ESE and W.\nThis study uses numerical experiments with the WRF model to clarify the condition of the wind on a day when a strong local wind occurred in Rumoi. To achieve this aim, the strong wind record observed in Rumoi is investigated. For comparative purposes, data for Mashike and Haboro were also checked, as these are coastal areas proximal to Rumoi (Fig. 1) . Here, a correlation analysis is performed between Rumoi and Mashike, and between Rumoi and Haboro using wind speeds recorded every 1-hr. Table 1 shows the result of the correlation analysis focusing on the two main wind directions in Rumoi. When the prevailing wind direction is ESE, the correlation coefficient has a lower value of less than 0.3, and a regression coefficient of 0.07-0.22. Using a comparison of the regression coefficients, it is evident that Rumoi experiences an ESE wind that is over four times stronger than at the other locations. However, when the W wind prevails in Rumoi, the wind speed in Rumoi correlates strongly with that in surrounding areas (correlation coefficient ~0.8), and the regression coefficient is larger compared to the case of the ESE wind.\nA strong wind event occurring in Rumoi at 03:00 LST on January 28, 2003, was selected for the first case, as it occurred concurrently with a weak wind event in Mashike and Haboro. The wind direction in Rumoi at this time was ESE (shown in Fig. 10 compared with numerical experiments). The wind speeds in Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro were 11.9 m/s, 3 m/s, and 2.2 m/s, respectively. The pressure pattern at this time was obtained from objective analysis datasets and is shown in Fig. 5 . Figure 5a shows low pressure located over the Sea of Japan to the west of Hokkaido at 03:00 LST January 28, 2003, which is consistent with the wind direction in Rumoi. In addition, as a contrasting second case, 15:00 LST March 8, 2005, was selected because western winds dominated in Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro (shown in Fig. 14) . The wind speed at the three points was similar (from 11 m/s to 15 m/s) and this is therefore an example of a non-locally strong wind occurring in relation to Rumoi. From the pressure pattern at this time (shown in Fig. 5b ), the pressure gradient is in a north-south direction in Hokkaido. By setting events based on the two main wind directions occurring in Rumoi, this study then aims to clarify the different characteristics of the wind conditions in this study area via numerical experiments."}, {"section_title": "III. Experimental design 1. Initial data", "text": "National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final (FNL) Operational Model Global Tropospheric Analyses product (NCEP/National Weather Service/NOAA/ U.S. Department of Commerce, 2000) is used as input meteorological data, as it has spatial ranges covering all over the world. The datasets were prepared every 6 h on 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grids. The analyses are available on the surface and at 26 levels from 1000 hPa to 10 hPa. In addition, mesoobjective analysis (MANAL) datasets by JMA were also used in the experiment, because their spatial resolution is 10 km, which is finer than that of the FNL. The temporal resolution of MANAL is the same as that of FNL (sixhourly). MANAL datasets consist of U and V components for wind, temperature, relative humidity, pressure reduced to mean sea level, and geopotential height. MANAL was selected as the main product for use, although FNL was used for supplementary elements that were not recorded in MANAL.\nThe SST data used were the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) by NOAA (Reynolds et al., 2007) , which were prepared separately using the meteorological datasets. OISST has a spatial resolution of 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0, which is equivalent to that of the FNL. However, it has a temporal resolution of one week (168 h), because SST changes minimally in time compared to other meteorological variables.\nThe DEM datasets used in the present study were provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, and cover an area of Japan from 40\u00b0N north, excluding Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and Habomai islands, with a spatial resolution of 10 m, which is much finer than the original DEM datasets of the WRF model. "}, {"section_title": "Meteorological model and experimental domains", "text": "Meteorological models, particularly mesoscale meteorological models, are widely used as analysis tools in engineering and agriculture, as well as in meteorology (e.g., Kusaka, 2009 ). The WRF model is a numerical weather prediction and atmospheric simulation system designed for both research and operational applications. The WRF effort is the result of a collaboration between university scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division, NOAA's NCEP and Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), the Department of Defense's Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (Skamarock et al., 2008) . WRF version 3.6.1 was released on August 14, 2014, and is used in this study.\nThe experimental timeframes used were from 21:00 LST on January 27, 2003 to 09:00 LST on January 28, 2003; and from 09:00 to 21:00 LST on March 8, 2005. In the two numerical experiments, the settings used are identical: 6-hr prior to and after the event time. The spin-up period is estimated as 6-12 hr with a spatial resolution of 10 km (Skamarock, 2004) , and 4-6 hr with that of 4 km (Weiss, 2008) . These periods are shorter than those used in previous studies because of the spatial resolution of 1 km in the innermost domain.\nWhen downscaling was applied in this experiment, the two-way nesting method was used, and Fig. 6 shows the three nested experimental domains. The center point of the outermost domain is located at 44\u00b0N and 141.5\u00b0E. The outermost domain has a grid spacing of 9 km (132 \u00d7 120 grids), and this was decreased by a factor of three for each of the nested domains; hence, the spatial resolution of the innermost domain is 1 km (208 \u00d7 208 grids). The DEM datasets are shown in Fig. 7 , and areas mentioned in the results are shown using two rectangles."}, {"section_title": "Selection of schemes", "text": "WRF offers multiple physics options that can be combined in many ways. Steinhoff et al. (2013) described several physical parameterization schemes of WRF in a case study of a representative summer foehn event over the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica. Surface states in Hokkaido are similar to those described in that case, and as such, the same schemes can be adopted in the present study. Therefore, for microphysics, the WRF Single-Moment 6-class (WSM6) scheme was used (Hong and Lim, 2006) . However, according to Skamarock et al. (2008) , several graupel-related terms of this scheme follow those of Lin et al. (1983) , but the ice-phase behavior of the scheme is considerably different, owing to the changes made by Hong et al. (2004) . However, Dudhia et al. (2008) implemented a procedure unifying the snow and graupel particles by assigning a single fall speed to both that is weighted by the mixing ratios, and this scheme therefore incorporates ice, snow, and graupel processes suitable for high-resolution experiments and is thus used in our study. In addition, the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) scheme was used for long-wave radiation (Mlawer et al., 1997) . The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. For short-wave radiation, the Dudhia scheme was used (Dudhia, 1989) . Furthermore, the MellorYamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN) scheme was used for the surface layer (Nakanishi, 2001; Nakanishi and Niino, 2004, 2006) , and for simulation of the land surface, the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) with soil temperature and moisture in four layers, fractional snow cover, and frozen soil physics was used (Chen and Dudhia, 2001 ). The planetary boundary layer was represented by the MYNN level 2.5 (Nakanishi and Niino, 2006) , and the cumulus parameterization was that of the Grell-Devenyi (GD) ensemble scheme (Grell and D\u00e9v\u00e9nyi, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "IV. Result of numerical experiments", "text": "1. Wind distribution at 03:00 LST on January 28, 2003 Figure 8 shows the reproduced experimental results obtained using the WRF model in the study area. A strong wind of approximately 25 m/s is apparent to the south of Mashike, and a wind speed peak also occurs in the vicinity of Rumoi, reaching approximately 18 m/s. The strong wind area near Rumoi spreads out to the Sea of Japan and forms a strong wind area over the sea. However, Mashike itself is associated with a weak wind, and is located between areas of strong winds. In addition, as seen in the northern part of Fig. 8 , the coast of the Sea of Japan near Haboro is associated with a relatively weak wind. Therefore, it can be concluded that a strong local wind occurs in the area of Rumoi. Figure 9 shows the wind speed change at Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro observed by AMeDAS, and in the numerical experiment from 21:00 LST on January 27, 2003 to 09:00 LST on January 28, 2003. In the observation result represented by the solid lines in Fig. 9 , all three points experienced a weak wind of approximately 4 m/s or less at 21:00 LST on January 27, 2003. However, the wind speed at Rumoi subsequently increased, although there was little change in the wind speed at Mashike and Haboro. This again shows that a strong local wind was blowing in Rumoi. According to the numerical experiment result represented by dashed lines in Fig. 9 , the numerical experiment tends to overestimate the wind speed especially in Mashike in comparison to the observation, but the overall trend during this event is well-represented, as is the local wind in Rumoi. The wind directions for Rumoi and Mashike are SE and E, respectively. In the southeastern part of Fig. 8 , the wind blows towards Rumoi from this direction. Conversely, in the northeastern part of the figure, the wind blows from E to NE, and there is an apparent change in the wind direction.\nThe result observed by AMeDAS is shown in Fig.  10 . Rumoi is determined as being the windiest of all the AMeDAS observation points. The result also shows that there is a strong local wind in Rumoi, in contrast to the weak winds observed in Mashike and Haboro (which agrees with the experimental result). Weak winds are also apparent across both coastal and inland areas. With respect to the wind direction, there was also good correspondence between the numerical experiments and the observations, except near Mashike, where the observations indicate a weak northerly wind but the experiment suggests an easterly wind."}, {"section_title": "Details of events occurring in Rumoi and Mashike at 03:00 LST on January 28, 2003", "text": "The previous section clarified the wind conditions in the study area. Figure 11 is a magnified figure using the same data as that presented in Fig. 8 , showing the areas around Rumoi and Mashike, but excluding Haboro. A low pressure is located in the south side of Mashike, and wind exists in both the west and east of this area. Additionally, there is a wind stream over the area moving from SE to NW. Mashike is located on the convergence line between two strong wind areas, indicating that the area is experiencing a weak wind. There is also a weak wind area over the Sea of Japan to the west of Mashike, where SE and E winds appear to converge. Figure 12 shows the results of another numerical experiment obtained using the WRF model in relation to the study area at 15:00 LST on March 8, 2005. The wind speed at sea is approximately 17 m/s, but when the westerly wind reaches the shore, the wind speed weakens and the speed on land is approximately 10 m/s. There is a strong wind blowing along the shore at this time in Rumoi, and the wind speed at Mashike and Haboro is also strong in this respect."}, {"section_title": "Wind distribution at 15:00 LST on March 8, 2005", "text": "According to the wind direction, the prevailing direction is westerly in this area, and this is in good agreement with the pressure gradient from the pressure distribution chart by MANAL (Fig. 5b) . There is no local wind direction change at this time, and therefore an evident converging line does not exist. The event is a typical representation of a strong westerly wind blowing from the sea. Figure 13 is a magnified figure adopting the same data as that presented in Fig. 12 , where a weak low pressure occurs in the south side of Mashike, but the wind is not separated in this area. There is no convergence line, even on close inspection, and therefore, the wind in Rumoi is as strong as that in Mashike.\nWind speed fields are shown in Fig. 14 . Areas where the observed wind speed is relatively high (Rumoi, Mashike, Haboro, Fukagawa, and Yagishiri) are well reproduced, both in relation to wind speed and direction. However, the wind direction in relation to the inland area (Horonuka, Tappu, and Shumarinai) is different from the results of the numerical experiment; the experiment was unable to reproduce the weak northerly and southerly winds. Figure 15 shows the temporal variation between Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro. A strong wind was blowing around Rumoi at that time, and this tendency is shown in the result of numerical experiment. However, there was a tendency for the value of the wind speed to be validated highly in the numerical experiments, which is the same tendency as for the previous event.\nV. Discussion"}, {"section_title": "Consideration of orographic wind", "text": "In the previous section, the reproduced experimental result demonstrated the wind distribution for a single point in time. In this section, we describe the temporal variation of the wind speed (shown in Fig. 9 ) in relation to Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro, using both observations and numerical experiment for the event in 2003. In Rumoi, the strongest wind measured is approximately 20 m/s; but the maximum wind speeds in Mashike and Haboro are approximately 10 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. From the start time of the experiment, the wind speed only increased locally in Rumoi, and the wind velocity was seen to be slightly elevated compared to the observation result. According to Fig. 8 and Fig. 10 , the wind direction in Mashike is not adequately reproduced for either wind speed or direction. This is because Mashike is located on the convergence line of wind directions, and the resolution of the numerical experiment was not appropriate in this respect. The estimated wind speeds in numerical experiments are systematically larger than those in actual AMeDAS observations. G\u00f3mez-Navarro et al. (2015) obtained qualitatively consistent results for complex terrain in the Alps region. They determined that the reproducibility of the ground surface roughness increases and the average distance between the observation point and the nearest grid point is shortened when the spatial resolution is improved, thereby improving the reproducibility of the wind speed. However, in this study, the spatial resolution of numerical experiments is high at 1 km, and thus the cause of the systematic overestimation is believed to be the influence of the planetary boundary layer scheme. Unresolved orography is not considered in the MYNN level 2.5 scheme selected in this research; therefore, even at a spatial resolution of 1 km it may be insufficient to express the complex terrain of this research area. As an example of finer experiments, Sheridan and Vosper (2012) carried out numerical simulations with 333-m resolution and reproduced counterflowing wind over the Owens Valley in the Sierra Nevada of California.\nThe topography of the region may explain why a strong local wind is observed in Rumoi. A lone mountain exists south of Mashike (Mt. Shokambetsu) that reaches a height of 1492 m above sea level (see Fig. 1 ). From Fig. 11 , it is clear that the prevailing wind around this area is forced to change direction near this mountain. In addition, the wind passes through the valley-shaped topography between Fukagawa and Rumoi (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 7) , and wind speeds are accelerated in the vicinity of Rumoi. This suggests the existence of a gap wind (e.g., Lackmann and Overland, 1989) . A similar result was shown in a study of a local easterly wind \"Kiyokawa-dashi\" in Japan (Sasaki et al., 2010) . To consider the influence of the lone mountain, a cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 16 . The cross section dissects the summit of Mt. Shokambetsu, as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 7 . According to Fig. 16 , there is a part of the vertical wind component that is strong, as evidenced by the waving flow of the wind in both upward and downward directions. The distribution of the equivalent potential temperature also varies along the direction of flow, suggesting the presence of a mountain wave extending to a height of approximately 10 km, which is in good agreement with the findings of \u00c1g\u00fastsson and \u00d3lafsson (2014) . Kawamura (1963) determined the prevailing wind direction based on wind observation data in Hokkaido, and revealed the distribution of the surface wind direction in winter. Kato (1983) conducted principal component analysis based on the daily average wind speed and atmospheric pressure data in Hokkaido, and created airflow charts. In these previous studies, it is shown that the wind blows from ESE and W in Rumoi, but no mention is made of the strong local wind in Rumoi and its mechanism. In this study, AMeDAS observation data are updated from 1981 to 2010, and strong winds in Rumoi are firstly shown using an analysis of wind speed and direction from data obtained in northwestern Hokkaido. The result of the prevailing wind direction is consistent with that in previous studies, and the mean wind speed of Rumoi is 77% and 33% larger than that in Mashike and Haboro, respectively. In addition, by conducting numerical experiments for the study area or northwestern Hokkaido, it is shown that the strong local wind blows due to the influence of the orography around Rumoi."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity experiment using surface layer scheme", "text": "Finally, a sensitivity experiment was performed to confirm any change in relation to using particular schemes in the numerical experiments. In Hokkaido, the land surface is covered with snow in winter, and therefore, the land surface schemes used in the reproduced simulation (Noah LSM) include a simple snow and sea-ice model (Chen and Dudhia, 2001) . For the sensitivity experiment, the land surface schemes were, therefore, altered to 5-layer thermal diffusion from the Noah LSM, and the layers are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cm; below these layers, the temperature is fixed at a deep-layer average (Skamarock et al., 2008) . However, there are no vegetation processes or snow schemes in the 5-layer thermal diffusion scheme.\nThe result of the sensitivity experiment is shown in Fig. 17 (magnified view) . A comparison between Fig. 17 and Fig. 11 shows that there are no significant differences in the wind directions. With respect to wind speed, a strong local wind at Rumoi and a weak wind area around Mashike, related to the convergence line of the wind, are also reproduced. However, the wind speed is decreased to approximately 2 m/s over the land area. The differences between results using a sensitivity experiment and the numerical experiment (control run) are shown in Fig. 18 , which shows an expansion of the strong wind region around Fukagawa and a weaker wind speed near Mashike. The wind speed changes greatly around the convergence line of the wind on the leeward side of Mt. Shokambetsu. The difference in wind vectors shows complex changes, and it appears that this wind change is affected by mountain waves.\nLand surface schemes affect ground roughness. Areas covered with snow are relatively smooth, enabling a higher wind speed. The result of the sensitivity experiment can be applied to the discussion of seasonal changes in wind speed at the same pressure distribution condition, but information relating to the physical snow depth is included in the initial data, and this may affect a slight change in the wind in this experiment. The statistical analysis in this study clarified seasonal changes in wind direction at some observation points around Rumoi. Other numerical experiments need to be applied to understand the wind spatial distribution in summer and to discuss seasonal changes of wind."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusions", "text": "In this study, a statistical analysis using 30-year AMeDAS datasets of wind speed and direction was performed. The mean wind speed at coastal locations (Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro) was higher than those in other areas except Fukagawa. The mean wind speed in Rumoi was approximately 5.0 m/s, and the wind speed in Rumoi is relatively strong compared to other locations in northwestern Hokkaido. With respect to a wind frequency analysis, Rumoi had the least frequency (7%) of weak winds (< 5 m/s), and Rumoi recorded the largest number of days with a maximum wind speed of more than 10 m/s as well as the Yagishiri island. As for the wind direction, ESE wind prevails in Rumoi throughout the year, but in winter, the westerly wind occupies more than 30% of the wind. The prevailing wind direction of other points around Rumoi was also ascertained, in addition to its seasonal changes. It was also found that the wind tended to blow from the north in winter at several observation points, in contrast to the direction during summer.\nTwo numerical experiments using the WRF model were applied to northwestern Hokkaido around Rumoi in order to reproduce the observed weather conditions. One was related to a strong wind event in Rumoi and a weak-wind event occurring concurrently in Mashike and Haboro. The other event related to a simultaneous strong-wind event in Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro. The results showed that there were good correspondences between the numerical experiments and observations. The numerical experiment results showed that there was a strong wind in Rumoi when the prevailing wind direction was ESE, but Mashike and Haboro experienced weak winds, even when a strong wind blew in Rumoi. This demonstrates that the strong wind over Rumoi is localized. The driving mechanism behind this strong wind is likely to be the result of a gap wind caused by the valley-shaped topography between Fukagawa and Rumoi. Additionally, Mt. Shokambetsu is located to the south of Mashike, and this generates mountain waves that affect the weak local wind over Mashike. However, when the prevailing wind direction is a westerly, the observed wind speeds in Rumoi, Mashike, and Haboro are almost equal, because the strong sea wind reaches these points simultaneously.\nA sensitivity experiment was performed to clarify changes in the land surface model of the meteorological model. Results showed that by changing the land surface model to one that did not incorporate snow, there was an alteration in the wind speed over land. "}]
