[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For many years, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) has maintained a Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs, which has included primarily academic institutions located in the United States and Canada. The print directory was a well-regarded resource for tracking basic information such as language and subfield specializations, student enrollment, number and type of degrees conferred, number and rank of faculty positions, and related demographic data for students and faculty. As the Directory evolved into an online resource, it became more difficult to produce an Annual Report with comprehensive information for all the North American institutions because fewer departments and programs provided data to the LSA. A primary objective of the 2012 LSA website redesign was to develop a much more robust Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs. This redesigned directory would serve multiple potential audiences: prospective graduate students, prospective faculty, and administrators seeking benchmarking data. With this overhaul complete, the LSA then embarked on extensive outreach efforts to enlist the participation of \"departmental contacts\" in order to update the listings for individual institutions. For the 2019 Report, there was a significant decrease in the number of reporting institutions from 2018 from 102 to 47. Due to this decline, the reported statistical information in the 2019 report, based on the LSA departmental directory, may not be an accurate representation of the linguistics population affiliated with academic departments and programs. The list of participating institutions for the 2019 report is located in the Appendix. The LSA has also monitored and/or participated in a number of national (U.S.) surveys that track the status of linguistics in higher education. The National Science Foundation (NSF) reports data from two relevant surveys: The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The federal Department of Education conducts and reports data from an annual survey, which is called the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), from over 7,500 post-secondary institutions. The most recent available data from all three of these surveys, towards the end of 2019 as well as at the beginning of 2020, are included in this report. In addition to these federal data initiatives, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences conducted a Humanities Departmental Survey (HDS), with financial and in-kind support from the LSA, in 2007-8 (HDS) and 2012-13 (HDS-2). The 2012-13 HDS-2 was published in 2014, and select elements of data covering the field of linguistics in higher education appear in this report. The 2017-2018 HDS-3 is forthcoming. The report also contains 2014 data from the 2017 NSF report on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering. In addition to the data collection and monitoring activities outlined above, the LSA maintains a member database with individual profiles that include demographic information, professional affiliations, and linguistic sub-specialties. Although most LSA members do not choose to provide demographic information, most do choose to provide professional and/or scholarly affiliations. Charts summarizing statistically relevant data from the LSA membership profiles are included in this report. The long-term goal of the LSA has been to compile data from all the relevant sources mentioned above and incorporate them into longitudinal charts showing change over time in the academic linguistics community. This year, the LSA is proud to present longitudinal charts for the first six years of the Annual Report, 2013-2018, alongside the 2019 statistics. The LSA also welcomes the opportunity to report on trends affecting linguists beyond academia, including those working in industry and government. Obtaining data for these populations is much more difficult, given the lack of systems in place for tracking these individuals and the lack of financial resources for creating such complex systems. LSA data on the number of degrees awarded by reporting institutions ( Figure 15B) shows an increase in all three types of degrees between 2013 and 2018, however for 2019 there is only an increase in the number of awarded Bachelor's degrees and PhDs, for which the rate is more stable. The LSA data shows a decline in Master's degrees for 2019. The assumption is that many linguists begin working in industries or areas of government after receiving their Bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Trends in Linguistics", "text": "The most common career outcome for linguistics PhDs is a position at an institution for higher education. There are, however, a significant number of linguists who work in industry or business careers. A small proportion of linguists pursue a career with the government after they graduate with their PhD. Within higher education, departments report that 40% of their faculty are full professors, but the nonprofessorial category is growing, particularly for women in other part-time positions. Additionally, women are almost on parity with men for tenure-track 1 jobs, but still fall below men in the number of full professor positions, with reporting departments showing an average of 2.9 male full professors to an average of 2.27 female full professors. The number of doctorate students is growing. Between 2011 and 2015 2 , 1377 doctoral degrees in linguistics were awarded, and in the first year alone of the next 5-year span between 2016 and 2020, nearly half of that number of doctorates have already been conferred with 635 linguistics students receiving PhDs from 2016-2017. Most linguistics doctoral degrees are awarded to women, who represent over half of graduate students in linguistics. This trend has remained consistent over the past six years. Overall, the number of linguistics PhDs rose in 2018 for both men and women according to the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (see Figure 17). More linguistics degrees, including Bachelor's, Master's, and PhDs, are awarded to White or Caucasian recipients than any other ethnicity. White degree awardees are followed by 1) Hispanic or Latino, 2) Asian, 3) Other or unknown race or ethnicity, 4) Two or more races, 5) Black or African American, 6) American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (see Figure 20A)."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LSA Directory", "text": "Data found in this report come from a variety of sources. Information about departments and programs is self-reported in the LSA's online Directory, found at www.linguisticsociety.org/programs.

The Directory was also updated in 2016 to include new fields with postal addresses so users may search programs by state or country. Calculations of numbers of job titles, students, degrees awarded, and average salaries are only from departments that have registered and submitted data about their students or faculty to the online directory in 2019 (47 departments, or under a fourth of all registered departments). Only a fourth of those responding offer the PhD as their highest degree (12 of the 47 registered departments that reported that information). Since not all departments submitted data in every area, each graph in the following report is a representation of the departments that have reported data in that realm (34 departments for job type, 30 for current students, 19 for degrees awarded, and 4 for salaries). The graph on graduate specializations was compiled from only those programs who reported their specializations on their departmental page. Data on ethnicity of faculty and student populations is collected via the Directory, but only 9 institutions provided such data. Given the paucity of data, this report does not include any charts on ethnicity of faculty or students using data derived from the Directory; however, ethnicity information is included from the 2017 report Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering from the NSF."}, {"section_title": "LSA Membership Database", "text": "The data reported in tables about individual linguists comes from the LSA membership database.

Most of the charts included in this report are for Regular Members who have completed their linguistics education. Data for Student Members (n=1044) are handled separately (within the tables on ethnicity, citizenship, and year in school). The charts do not include data for lapsed regular and/or student members (n=12,029). This distinction is drawn primarily because there is little discernible difference demographically, and the lapsed members are less likely to have provided any profile data. 3"}, {"section_title": "Government-Sponsored Surveys", "text": "The data reported in several non-LSA tables detailing trends in linguistics over time come from three sources that survey samples of respondents. Data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) is collected annually from questionnaires submitted from individuals receiving doctorates in the past year. Respondents represent approximately 420 institutions. Information from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is collected biennially from a sample of doctoral recipients over a career-long time span. Reported data are weighted using the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) sample. The Linguistics data from the SDR is aggregated into the minor category of Other Social Sciences. The data from the SED reflect the survey results from the year 2017, which were released in December 2019. Data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is collected from tallies provided by an annual survey of approximately 7,500 institutions. The IPEDS survey is conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. The IPEDS-derived charts in this report were first created in 2011 by the LSA's Linguistics in Higher Education Committee, and then updated in 2020 with the help of Jonathan Gordon to reflect more current data.

Some of the areas where linguistics differs substantially are the average number of linguistics graduate students per department as compared to other humanities disciplines.

The number of non-student members with tenure currently or prior to retirement has grown steadily over the years, with a 20.55% increase since 2013 (see figure 6C). Figure 6C also shows an anomalous rise in the number of nontenured, non-student members in 2015. There might have been an error in the way the data was exported in 2015. Furthermore, the fact that the number of LSA members with tenure is increasing may not reflect the number of tenured linguistics professors outside of the LSA member directory. It is possible that the tenured faculty who contribute to the LSA are more involved in the organization than non-tenured faculty and therefore represent a larger percentage of the membership.   Note that Figure 8 shows nearly twice as many women in the \"Other Full Time\" position than men in those categories; however, men still outnumber women, on average, in the \"Full Professor\" category. There are also on average more women in \"Other Part-Time\" and \"Associate Professor\" positions for 2019.
