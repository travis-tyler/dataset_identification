[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Substantial research exists on maternal depression and childhood poverty and their debilitating effects on both maternal health and early child development. Although most of the research implicating the pathways by which maternal depression disrupts child development has been conducted on European-White descendent families [1], evidence suggests that the mother-child relationship is situated within the economic and sociocultural contexts in which families live [2]. As such, the intersection between maternal depression and poverty may affect children from ethnic minorities differently. Although Latino families are affected disproportionately by poverty [3], we found few research studies and no systematic reviews on the effect of maternal depression on child development within this vulnerable population. Latina mothers living in poverty experience numerous stressors related to both social adversity and ethnic minority status and are subsequently susceptible to depressive symptomology [4]. Prevalence rates of depression (mild to severe) in Latina mothers range from 12 to 59% in the perinatal period, compared to 10-15% in the general population [5]. Moreover, lack of accessible, affordable, and culturally competent mental health care for Latina mothers has been well-documented [6]. Little is known, however, about the extent to which mental health in Latinas is related to their children's socioemotional development. This is the first systematic review to consolidate studies examining the relationship between Latina mothers' depression and child socioemotional outcomes. Based on a social-ecological perspective, our review aims to study interpersonal and contextual pathways linking maternal depression in Latinas to a young child's (birth to five years old) socioemotional outcomes in the broader context of sociocultural and economic stressors (Fig 1)."}, {"section_title": "Socioemotional outcomes", "text": "Socioemotional competencies underlie early childhood mental health and encompass \"a child's developing capacity from birth through five years of age to form close and secure adult and peer relationships; experience, regulate, and express emotions in socially and culturally appropriate ways; and explore the environment and learn-all in the context of family, community, and culture.\" [7] (p. 2). The relationship between maternal depression and disruptions in a young child's socioemotional development and related behavioral manifestations has been well replicated throughout infancy and early childhood [1,8]. Our review focuses on adverse early social and emotional outcomes associated with maternal depression and greater risk for psychopathology later in life [9]: 1) temperamental traits (e.g., higher negative emotionality and lower self-regulatory capacity) in infants that increase vulnerability to stressful caregiving environments; 2) infant social withdrawal behavior; 3) insecure mother-child attachment [10]; and 4) internalizing (e.g., fearfulness, anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., aggression) behaviors in toddlers and preschoolers [9]. We focus on maternal rather than paternal depression due to the high prevalence of maternal depression during sensitive developmental periods [11] and fetal exposure to prenatal depression during pregnancy.\nPrenatal. Studies (n = 2) conducted in the prenatal period found a significant relationship between prenatal depressive symptoms and infant self-regulation [56,57]. In Fuller et al.'s study, higher prenatal maternal depressive symptoms on a continuum (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, score range 5-27) positively moderated the relationship between neighborhood stress and infant self-regulatory difficulties (IBQ-R). Luecken et al.'s study measured the relationship between infant self-regulation (cortisol responses) and prenatal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale \ufffd13). Both prenatal depressive symptoms and perceived lack of social support predicted disrupted infant self-regulatory processes as indicated "}, {"section_title": "Maternal sensitivity", "text": "Prenatally, maternal depression may alter biochemical pathways associated with physiological and emotional regulation, thus, undermining the foundation on which children develop socioemotional competencies [12,13]. Adverse outcomes, however, may still be mitigated by nurturing mother-child interactions [14]. The early social and cultural caregiving environment continues to shape a young child's socioemotional developmental trajectory and, thereby, promotes future resiliency or exacerbates risk for mental health disorders over the life course [15]. The influence of maternal depression on parenting behaviors (e.g. maternal sensitivity) may underlie the relationship between maternal depression and child socioemotional maladjustment [16,17]. Mothers who are depressed may be less able to provide sensitive interactions needed to develop and sustain early socioemotional competencies, especially in the context of economic stressors [18,19]. Given that cultural beliefs and values influence parenting and subsequent child development [20,21], the interaction between maternal sensitivity and maternal mental health on young children's socioemotional outcomes may differ based on sociocultural context [2,22,23]. In fact, similar parenting behaviors often result in contradictory socioemotional child outcomes depending on the cultural meaning underlying the behavior [20]. The effects of maternal depression on maternal sensitivity and subsequent mother-child interactions are both a modifiable and necessary target for intervention [24]. Empirical evidence suggests that integrated interventions during the first five years of life to reduce maternal depression and enhance parenting skills may ultimately improve children's socioemotional developmental trajectories [16], particularly for the most vulnerable mother-child dyads [25]. However, culturally relevant interventions necessitate further research into the intersection of these variables and related child outcomes within the broader sociocultural and economic context.\nTwo studies examined the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms, maternal sensitivity, and acculturation during toddlerhood and preschool [2,64]. In the ECLS-B's full sample representing the general population, maternal depressive symptoms measured at nine months (CES-D \ufffd 16) and 24 months (Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form Instrument) were inversely associated with maternal sensitivity scores [2]. However, in analyses stratified by ethnicity, patterns of depression at nine months and 24 months (e.g., remittent, late onset, chronic) were not significantly associated with maternal sensitivity in Latina mothers [2]. In contrast, Palermo et al. found a significant inverse association between maternal sensitivity and maternal mental health problems-a variable combining maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D), parenting stress, and self-efficacy measures. In both studies, more acculturated mothers scored significantly higher on maternal sensitivity measures than less acculturated mothers. In fact, maternal acculturation (as measured by either primary language use, nativity, or a combination of generational status and language proficiency), not maternal depressive symptoms, was most consistently and significantly associated with maternal sensitivity scores [2,64]. Maternal sensitivity was also tested as a mediator between maternal depressive symptoms and child outcomes. Combining stress and depression measures into one variable again yielded the stronger association: maternal sensitivity significantly mediated the association between maternal mental health problems and child behavioral functioning (Problem Behavior Scale) in preschoolers [64]. Although Huang et al. found that maternal sensitivity mediated the associations between maternal depressive symptoms and child attachment in toddlers, the mediation was not significant in Latina mother-child dyads-a finding that differed from the ECLS-B's full sample [2]. In summary, unless maternal depressive symptoms were combined with maternal stress, maternal sensitivity scores were not correlated with maternal depression and did not function as a significant mediator between maternal depressive symptoms and child outcomes. Both studies assessed and adjusted for demographic moderators (e.g., socioeconomic status, maternal education).\nMaternal sensitivity scores were more consistently correlated with maternal acculturation than maternal depression, whereby high levels of maternal acculturation were linked to high levels PLOS ONE of maternal sensitivity scores-thus raising the question \"Are maternal sensitivity measures more closely linked to cultural assimilation than maternal processes that protect children?\" Although previous research has supported maternal sensitivity as a protective cross-cultural construct critical for healthy child developmental outcomes [68], some evidence asserts that measures used to operationalize this complex construct may be culture-specific [69]. In fact, the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale, used to measure maternal sensitivity during infancy in the ECLS-B, may detect maternal knowledge of early child development more sensitively than either maternal depression or self-efficacy [70]. Although positive correlations between maternal sensitivity and preschooler's behavioral functioning suggest that maternal sensitivity measures may at least partially apply to Latina mothers in relation to child wellbeing [64], measures are likely not capturing key maternal processes specific to less acculturated Latina mothers; these processes warrant further exploration. Moreover, considering that increased maternal sensitivity scores in more acculturated Latina mothers did not moderate the relationship between maternal depression and child outcomes in toddlers or preschoolers [2,64], unexplored interpersonal or contextual factors in relation to maternal depression may play a superseding role in determining child well-being."}, {"section_title": "Economic and sociocultural stressors", "text": "The relationship between mother and child occurs within the context of poverty in >26% of Latino families with young children [26]. Poverty-related stressors, which have also been used as a proxy for poverty, encompass numerous risk factors for children: food insecurity, overcrowded housing, and community violence. In fact, meta-analyses within the general population have shown that poverty heightens the significant positive association between maternal depression and children's socioemotional difficulties [1,27]. Ethnic minority status also magnifies these effects, but understudied social and cultural pathways underlying such disparities have not been disentangled [1]. Theoretical frameworks such as the Family Stress Model (FSM) hypothesize that economic stressors engender parental stress and depression, compromising parental quality which could https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230256.g001\nEconomic stressors. Studies using the FSM (n = 3) during early childhood found consistent positive correlations between maternal depressive symptoms and economic stressors: food insecurity, community violence, and economic hardship [64][65][66]. Maternal depressive symptoms were then tested as a mediator between these poverty-related stressors and child outcomes. In a cross-sectional study examining Latino families in rural America across 13 states, maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D short form \ufffd 10) were not found to significantly mediate the relationship between household food insecurity and child behavioral functioning (CBCL) [65]. The study was limited by its cross-sectional nature and the potentially confounding child age range (one-and-a-half to five years old, mean = 42 months). However, a longitudinal study examining children from a nationally representative sample of Head Start programs across one school year also found statistically non-significant effects: child behavioral functioning (Personal Maturity Scale, CBCL, Teacher Report, and the Behavior Problems Index) was not significantly associated with individual study variables: maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D short form \ufffd 10), violence exposure, family structure, or parenting style [66]. Furthermore, maternal mental health problems (CES-D \ufffd 16, parenting stress, self-efficacy) and maternal sensitivity did not mediate the association between economic hardship and child behavioral functioning (Problem Behavior Scale) in a longer longitudinal study spanning 14 months until kindergarten entry [64]. Although the FSM studies provided no support for the mediating role of maternal depressive symptoms between poverty-related stressors and child outcomes, Aisenberg's cross-sectional study found that maternal distress symptomatology, as measured by depressive symptoms (BSI \ufffd 63), anxiety, and adult post-traumatic stress disorder, significantly mediated the relationship between exposure to community violence and externalizing and internalizing behaviors (CBCL) in preschool children [67]. Two studies examined maternal depressive symptoms as a moderator between economic stressors and child outcomes. Waters et al. tested both chronic overcrowded housing and chronic maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) as potential moderators between child RSA reactivity and child externalizing behavioral difficulties (BASC-2) from infancy through middle childhood [63]. Only maternal depressive symptoms functioned as a significant moderator, indicating that maternal depression posed a stronger risk for children than overcrowded housing in a sample of Mexican-American dyads [63]. Fuller et al. tested maternal depressive symptoms on a continuum (PHQ-9, score range 5-27) as a moderator between infant temperament (IBQ-R) and prenatal material hardship (food insecurity, housing disrepair, financial difficulty, neighborhood stress) [56]. Prenatal depressive symptoms significantly moderated the relationship between neighborhood stress and low infant regulatory capacity [56]. Acculturation. Two studies examined the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and child socioemotional outcomes in context of acculturation (i.e., cultural adaptation) [2,64]. A culturally integrated FSM tested whether acculturation levels moderated the pattern of associations between maternal mental health problems (CES-D, parenting stress, self-efficacy) and preschool behavioral functioning (Problem Behavior Scale) [64]. Palermo et al. found significantly higher measures of maternal sensitivity in more acculturated mothers compared to less acculturated mothers, but adding maternal acculturation measures to models did not moderate the associations between maternal mental health problems and child outcomes. Nor did maternal nativity status moderate the associations among maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16), maternal sensitivity, and child attachment [2]. Despite the lack of studies explicitly examining the effects of maternal acculturation on the relationship between maternal depression and child development, a significant pattern repeatedly emerged across studies. Children of U.S.-born Latina mothers had consistently poorer socioemotional outcomes than children of foreign-born Latina mothers across domains and developmental windows: higher infant negativity in two studies [56,57]; higher rates of insecure attachment in toddlers, including almost double the rate (20.7% vs 11.5%) of disorganized attachment, the most maladaptive style [2]; and higher externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems in preschoolers [62]. Higher rates of insecure attachment in toddlers (49.4% vs 39.6%) occurred despite higher maternal sensitivity scores, family incomes, and maternal education levels in U.S-born Latina mothers from the ECLS-B [2]. Furthermore, higher child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in preschoolers occurred despite higher resting RSA levels, a measure found to protect children significantly from socioemotional difficulties in the full sample of Mexican-American children [62]. Potential links between maternal nativity status and maternal depression in relation to child outcomes remained predominantly unexplored, leaving a gap in our understanding.\nDepression has long been recognized as an interdependent phenomenon inextricably linked to interpersonal and contextual factors [71]. As such, economic stressors and lack of social support were significantly associated with maternal depression in our studies. We also found some evidence for the mediating [67] and moderating [56,63] role of maternal depression between poverty-related stressors and child socioemotional outcomes. Our review found no support for using the FSM during the preschool years, in contrast to FSM studies conducted during middle childhood and adolescence within the broader literature [31,32,72]. Perhaps the cumulative effects of chronic stressors are not measurable until later in childhood. The preschool years, however, were the least likely to yield significant associations between maternal depression and child development in our studies unless maternal depression was combined with a measure of stress. Elevated scores on both maternal depression and stress measures may reflect more chronic depressive symptoms [73], a pattern of depression associated with greater risk for child maladjustment in our longitudinal studies [2,62,63]. Moreover, some empirical evidence suggests that maternal stress (e.g., parenting stress, limited social support, marital conflict) may mediate the relationship between maternal depression and behavior problems in toddlers [74] and preschoolers [73]. In immigrant Latino families, economic stressors combined with parental immigration-related stress have predicted increased behavioral difficulties in preschoolers [75]. Although studies in our review did not address specific sociocultural stressors, a small but growing body of literature shows that culturally relevant precursors of maternal depression in Latina mothers (e.g., stressful life events, discrimination, acculturative stress) have been associated with socioemotional maladjustment during early developmental windows, suggesting that maternal stress in general may affect a child's capacity for healthy socioemotional outcomes beginning as early as the prenatal period [38,[76][77][78]. Moreover, bio-behavioral profiles indicative of chronic stress across succeeding generations have been found in Mexican-origin women, whereby third generation women exhibited blunted maternal cortisol during pregnancy [79]. These increasing socioemotional vulnerabilities echo our findings linking consistently poorer socioemotional outcomes to children of U.S.-born mothers compared to children of foreign-born mothers. Such outcomes occurred even within the context of higher family incomes, maternal education, and higher levels of maternal sensitivity scores frequently found in succeeding generations [2]. A previous study examining school readiness also noted healthier socioemotional adjustment in kindergarten children of foreign-born Latino parents compared to children of U.S.-born parents of other races and ethnicities, as rated by teachers [80]. Similarly, a study examining the relationship between cultural adaptation in parents and behavioral functioning in preschoolers found that high US identity in Latino parents was associated with more externalizing behaviors, whereas higher ethnic parental identity predicted lower levels of child externalizing and internalizing behaviors [81]. Increased parental acculturation, as measured by language usage, has also been linked to lower (i.e., less adaptive) cortisol responses in preschoolers living in poverty [75]. Although cross-generational research supports an immigrant paradox in behavioral outcomes during adolescence (e.g., substance abuse, teen pregnancy, delinquency), research examining socioemotional outcomes in children under five years of age has been scarce [82]. This is the first review, to our knowledge, to have found support for the Latino paradox in early childhood mental health. If an immigrant advantage exists throughout early developmental windows in the socioemotional domain, why and when does it erode? The interaction between maternal nativity and maternal mental health in relation to child outcomes was rarely examined in our studies, preventing us from fully grasping the underlying mechanisms for this apparent decline. However, our findings clearly indicate that a) this pattern can be observed within sensitive early developmental windows; b) maternal mental health and early child development are intimately connected; and c) contextual stressors are salient precursors of maternal mental health. Maternal biopsychosocial stress across generations stemming from the chronic stressors inherent in unequitable societal structures may be a salient contributing factor; protective cultural factors such as collectivism that confer psychological resilience [83] may also be lost in subsequent generations. Combining models based on risk (e.g., developmental-risk framework) and resilience (e.g., ecocultural theory) may help elucidate underlying mechanisms for the Latino Paradox [84]."}, {"section_title": "PLOS ONE", "text": "otherwise serve as a child's protective buffer from poverty; as such, maternal psychological functioning may serve as a mediating mechanism by which poverty-related stressors predict child maladjustment [28]. The few FSM studies examining Latino children have focused primarily on middle childhood and adolescence and provide evidence for the mediating role of maternal depression between poverty-related stressors and socioemotional child outcomes [29,30] as well as revealing culture-specific ways in which these variables may interact [31,32]. However, not only do we know little about the validity of these models for Latino children during early childhood [33] but culture-specific stressors have rarely been used as anchors for these studies-despite the integral role of cultural influences on developmental processes [34,35]. Culture-specific stressors (e.g., discrimination, stressful life events, and acculturative stress) have predicted parental depression [36,37] and provide key sociocultural contexts in which to examine maternal and child health [38]. Acculturative stress, stemming from psychosocial adjustment to a host culture, may affect both immigrants and later generations who have simultaneously assimilated to a new culture and maintained cultural heritage [39]. In immigrant women, acculturative stress is often accompanied by family separation, social and linguistic isolation, and discrimination [40]-salient contributors of perinatal depression among Mexican-American mothers [41]. The cumulative effects of these stressors on the relationship between maternal mental health and the child's gestational and early childhood experiences may alter not only the child's life course but the physiology of subsequent generations via biological (e.g., epigenetic) mechanisms [38,42,43] and interpersonal (e.g., parenting) processes [42]. The Latino paradox, wherein less acculturated Latinos experience better health outcomes than more acculturated Latinos, has been documented for maternal and child health: birth weights [44] and breastfeeding rates [45]. However, investigators have not, to our knowledge, explored the relationship between maternal biopsychosocial functioning (e.g., depression) and early child socioemotional outcomes in the context of the Latino paradox.\n\nagreed to include these studies; the broad age range would provide a representative sample of Latina mothers in the United States. We contacted authors for maternal age distribution if needed. Moreover, we included three dissertations meeting inclusion criteria. We extracted data for cognitive outcomes because they are interwoven with developing socioemotional competencies early in life [9]. However, these were excluded from our final qualitative synthesis and placed in a supplemental table in order to focus our attention on early social and emotional outcomes (S1 Table).\n\nsensitivity in relation to child socioemotional outcomes; and 3) contextual stressors culturally relevant to Latina mothers and their young children living in poverty (economic and sociocultural stressors).\nthrough dysfunctional cortisol responses: heightened cortisol output for 12-week old infants with high temperamental negativity but blunted cortisol for infants with low negativity [57]. Both studies co-varied for postpartum depressive symptoms, suggesting that dysfunctional self-regulatory processes were associated with the prenatal rather than postnatal psychosocial environment. Infancy. Studies conducted during infancy (n = 2) revealed significant correlations between maternal depression and adverse infant socioemotional outcomes. Six-month old infants whose mothers were diagnosed with major depression (based on the DSM-IV criteria) scored significantly higher than infants with non-depressed mothers on both intrapersonal and interpersonal social withdrawal behaviors (Alarm Distress Baby Scale): facial expression, vocalizations, relationship, attraction, eye contact, and self-stimulation [53]. Bidirectional interpersonal associations, implying disrupted social synchrony, were noted in a separate study: higher infant negativity (IBQ-R) at six weeks was associated with increased maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS > 13) at 12 weeks; moreover, increased maternal depressive symptoms were associated with decreased social support [57]. Each study measuring infant outcomes (n = 4) yielded a significant association between maternal depressive symptoms and adverse infant outcomes regardless of study design, analytical analysis, child outcome measures, or maternal depression measures. Toddlerhood. Two studies focused on the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and child outcomes in toddlers aged 12 to 36 months. Martinez examined the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) and child aggression, compliance, and negative emotionality (CBCL and Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment) [58]. Mild and moderate depressive symptoms at 24 months significantly predicted increased negative infant emotionality six months later [58]. Huang et al. examined the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16 at nine months, Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form Instrument at 24 months), maternal sensitivity, and toddler child attachment (Toddler Attachment Sort-45 Instrument). Analyses stratified by ethnicity revealed that chronic maternal depression in Latina mothers posed a higher odds ratio for child insecure attachment at 24 months than any other ethnicity (Odds Ratio = 8.12, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.07-61.68, p = .04) [2]; however, the significance of this association disappeared when maternal sensitivity was added into the model [2]. As such, both studies found significant relationships between toddler socioemotional outcomes and the chronicity [2] or severity [58] of maternal depressive symptoms. Preschool. Four studies examined the correlation between maternal depressive symptoms and behavioral functioning (CBCL) in preschoolers. Neither La Roche et al. or Lequericia and Hermosa found significant associations between maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16 or subscale of Ilfield's Psychiatric Symptom Index) and preschool behavioral functioning [50,59]. However, neither study adjusted for potential confounding variables (e.g., maternal demographic characteristics, child's age), which could have obscured possible associations. Only when maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) were combined with measures of stress did significant associations emerge between maternal depression and child behaviors: maternal depressive symptoms in conjunction with stress was significantly positively associated with child internalizing problems [60]. Two of these studies were cross-sectional [50,60], and one study spanned a three-month time-frame [59], providing a limited perspective into the trajectory of these associations. During children's mental health treatment spanning three years, Mennen et al. found significant associations between maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) and preschoolers' behavioral functioning: externalizing and internalizing behaviors (CBLC) and socialization (Vineland Screener) [61]. Compared to children whose mothers were not depressed, children\nof mothers with depression began treatment with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors and lower socialization scores, progressed more slowly during treatment despite receiving more mental health services, and finished treatment with lower levels of behavioral functioning [61]. Unlike the consistently significant associations found between maternal depression and adverse infant outcomes, significant correlations during the preschool years emerged only when 1) the study design and analysis captured developmental changes over time or when 2) maternal depressive symptoms were combined with a measurement of stress. Infancy through early childhood. In longitudinal studies spanning infancy through early childhood (n = 2), the interaction between maternal depressive symptoms and an infant's regulatory capacity was found to predict child behavioral functioning through the preschool years [62] and middle childhood [63]. Infants' resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) [62] and RSA reactivity [63] were measured as a physiological index for vagal tone and subsequent underlying regulatory capacity. The interaction between low infant RSA reactivity and exposure to maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) at one and three-and-a-half years old predicted significantly greater externalizing difficulties (Behavior Assessment System for Children) at 7-years-old [63]. Likewise, the interaction between low infant resting RSA and exposure to depressive symptoms (EPDS \ufffd 13) from three weeks to six months old predicted greater internalizing and externalizing child behavior problems (CBCL) at 36 months [62]. Additionally, higher maternal depressive symptoms (CES-D \ufffd 16) at 36 months yielded other significant correlations: maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS \ufffd 13) at six months and more child behavior problems [62]. In summary, the interaction between infant self-regulatory processes and the chronicity of maternal depressive symptoms predicted greater child behavioral difficulties [62,63]. Measurements assessing exposure to maternal depressive symptoms across multiple points in the child's life strengthened both studies."}, {"section_title": "Current study", "text": "Although the Latino population comprises the largest ethnic minority group in the US [3], young Latino children remain an understudied population.

We did not exclude for co-morbid symptoms or diagnoses such as anxiety, stress, or another form of psychological distress.

Of the eleven studies published within the past ten years, seven were published in the past five years, indicating that the relationship between maternal depression in Latinas and child development has only recently begun to receive scholarly attention. Consistent with previous meta-analyses conducted on European-White mother-child dyads, the preschool years were the least likely to yield statistically significant inverse associations between maternal depression and child well-being; infancy had the strongest inverse correlations, suggesting that younger children may be more vulnerable to the influences of maternal depression [1,8]. Chronicity and severity of maternal depression also predicted child outcomes; more frequent exposure to maternal depression across infancy and early childhood was linked to increased child maladjustment by early and middle childhood. We also found some evidence for the moderating [56,63] and mediating role [67] of maternal depression between contextual stressors and child outcomes. Maternal stress in conjunction with depression heightened associations between maternal depression and child maladjustment [60,64,67]. In contrast, maternal sensitivity less consistently affected the relationship between maternal depression and child outcomes [2,64]. One of the most consistent patterns emerged between maternal nativity and child socioemotional development: children of U.S.-born Latina mothers had significantly poorer developmental outcomes than children of foreign-born Latina mothers across socioemotional domains and throughout early developmental windows-from infant negativity to toddler attachment and preschool behavioral functioning [2,56,57,62]."}, {"section_title": "Clinical implications", "text": "Maternal depression is treatable, and its effects on child socioemotional outcomes can be minimized. A meta-analysis revealed that non-pharmaceutical treatment of depression during pregnancy not only improved maternal mood but improved child functioning-particularly infant regulatory capacity [85]. These outcomes provide causational support for the link between prenatal depression and infant socioemotional outcomes as well as subsequent evidence for the intergenerational transmission of mental health disparities. Furthermore, the World Health Organization recommends that interventions should treat maternal depression and support the mother-child relationship concurrently [24]. Well-designed, culturally responsive interventions that mitigate maternal stress and strengthen the mother-child relationship may also foster healthy child development. Although depression is treatable and support is critical during early developmental windows when interventions would be most preventative and cost-effective, treatment often remains inaccessible to Latina mothers even after controlling for income levels [6,86]. Given that maternal depression is highly correlated with adversity, lack of appropriate treatment for mothers suffering from depression and their young children may further compound disparities in children's socioemotional development. Policies should address the need to support maternal mental health as early as the prenatal period. Effective interventions for maternal depression in Latinas have focused on culturally sensitive psychoeducation, emotional support, and access to community resources [87]. Exploratory family-level interventions have also embraced potential sociocultural strengths such as kinship and familism (i.e., family interdependence), resulting in decreased maternal depressive symptoms and decreased internalizing and externalizing behaviors in children [88]. Moreover, a culturally-tailored intervention targeting postpartum depression and motherchild interactions in infants and toddlers lowered maternal depression scores and improved maternal perceptions of the child's socioemotional competence [89]. Upstream approaches in immigrant women should address culturally relevant stressors and barriers that contribute to depression and stress, such as potential and poignant losses experienced during immigration: social support networks lost through family separation, a sense of belonging dislodged by discrimination, and access to community resources impeded by language barriers [41]."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Due to scarce research examining maternal depression in Latinas and child socioemotional outcomes, we had a limited number of studies-five of which were cross-sectional. Studies were too heterogeneous to conduct a meta-analysis. Furthermore, most studies during the preschool years used maternal-reported measures of child behavior such as the CBCL. Behavior ratings may be influenced by maternal cultural expectations [20] and maternal depression. Mothers with depression may be more likely to view their children negatively, resulting in potentially biased ratings [1]. However, three out of five studies using maternal reported child measures in longitudinal studies adjusted for concurrent depression. We also only included studies conducted in the US. Although this focus prevented confounding factors that may have arisen from research in several host countries, our findings cannot be generalized outside of the US. Moreover, the Latino population is not homogeneous; subpopulations from Latin American countries have various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds as well as reasons for coming to the United States [90]. Furthermore, acculturation may differ among Latino sub-groups [38]. Although we extracted data such as country of origin and acculturation, eight studies did not include country of origin, and seven did not measure acculturation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This is the first systematic review to examine Latina mother-child dyads in relation to maternal depression and child socioemotional development. We found significant positive correlations between maternal depression and contextual stressors, inverse correlations between maternal depression and child well-being, and evidence of the moderating and mediating role of maternal depression between contextual stressors and child socioemotional outcomes. We also connected fragmented evidence across studies delineating a concerning and significant crossgenerational decline in young Latino children's socioemotional outcomes; future research should examine the underlying mechanisms. Indeed, socioemotional developmental processes are critical throughout infancy and early childhood-processes allowing children to form friendships, learn in school, develop resiliency, and eventually strengthen our intrinsically interconnected society [91].
