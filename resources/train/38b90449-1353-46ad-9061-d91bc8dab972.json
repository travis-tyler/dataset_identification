[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "There is no consensus on whether climate change has yet affected the statistics of tropical cyclones, owing to their large natural variability and the limited period of consistent observations. In addition, projections of future tropical cyclone activity are uncertain, because they often rely on coarse-resolution climate models that parameterize convection and hence have difficulty in directly representing tropical cyclones. Here we used convection-permitting regional climate model simulations to investigate whether and how recent destructive tropical cyclones would change if these events had occurred in pre-industrial and in future climates. We found that, relative to pre-industrial conditions, climate change so far has enhanced the average and extreme rainfall of hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria, but did not change tropical cyclone wind-speed intensity. In addition, future anthropogenic warming would robustly increase the wind speed and rainfall of 11 of 13 intense tropical cyclones (of 15 events sampled globally). Additional regional climate model simulations suggest that convective parameterization introduces minimal uncertainty into the sign of projected changes in tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall, which allows us to have confidence in projections from global models with parameterized convection and resolution fine enough to include tropical cyclones.\nTropical cyclones are among the deadliest and most destructive natural disasters.

Sea-surface temperature (SST) warming has been observed and is expected to continue, which would intensify tropical cyclones 8 . However, sub-surface ocean Article reSeArcH structure changes are also important for tropical cyclone intensity, and may be a dampening effect in the future 40 . Considering atmospheric factors, anthropogenic warming is expected to be greater in the upper compared to lower troposphere in response to increased greenhouse gases, which could weaken tropical cyclones. However, the tropical tropopause is expected to cool as its height increases, which would strengthen the maximum potential intensity of tropical cyclones, as observed in the Atlantic 41, 42 . Because maximum potential intensity theory applies to mature tropical cyclones, this means the strength of intense tropical cyclones may increase. In addition to thermodynamic influences on tropical cyclones, changes in atmospheric circulation are also important. Projected increases in vertical wind shear could work to suppress tropical cyclones regionally 43 . Finally, it is uncertain how the seedling disturbances that serve as tropical cyclone precursors may change.\nObservational consistency issues and compensating physical mechanisms for tropical cyclone changes are only some of the challenges in understanding anthropogenic influences on tropical cyclones. In addition, it can be difficult for climate models to represent the observed climatology of intense tropical cyclones, even at the 0.25\u00b0 horizontal resolution that is considered to be high resolution for global models 21 . Furthermore, the decades-long simulations used to project future tropical cyclone activity typically parameterize convection. However, the associated uncertainty introduced into tropical cyclone projections has not been systematically understood.\nThe purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of anthropogenic influences on tropical cyclones by quantifying the impact of climate change so far, and in the future, on the intensity and rainfall of destructive tropical cyclone events using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. We first addressed the question of how tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall could change if hurricanes like Katrina, Irma and Maria occurred in pre-industrial or future warmer climates. We then investigated the robustness of our results by extending the analysis to 15 tropical cyclone events sampled globally under three future climates.

Although previous studies considered individual tropical cyclones, the modelling frameworks used differ (Methods). Our use of one model for many events allows us to assess the robustness of the climate change responses more directly among events. We selected tropical cyclones that were particularly destructive (in terms of fatalities and economic losses) and represent various tropical cyclone basins. Many of the tropical cyclones were intense in terms of wind speed, but two were weak tropical cyclones with moderate-to-heavy rainfall (typhoon Morakot and hurricane Bob). Boundary conditions for the pre-industrial and Representative Concentration Pathway experiments were based on those from the historical, adjusted to remove and add, respectively, the thermodynamic component of climate change (Methods).

Simulations that used convective parameterization are denoted 'P'. In addition, a period of rapid intensification was observed for all three hurricanes, which was most pronounced for hurricane Maria. However, the hindcasts failed to represent rapid intensification, a challenge that remains in operational forecasting 44 . Given that the simulated hurricane tracks and intensities compare reasonably well with the observed tracks, albeit with a failure to reproduce rapid intensification, we evaluated the response in hurricane intensity to past and future anthropogenic forcings. For each of the hurricanes, the ensemble-mean wind speed and SLP-based intensity time series are indistinguishable between the pre-industrial and historical simulations, whereas there is a distinct increase in intensity from the historical to RCP8.5 climates for a substantial portion of each hurricane's lifetime (Fig. 2a-c and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c) . To assess the significance (P = 0.05) of the intensity changes, we calculated the peak intensity over each hurricane's lifetime based on maximum wind speed ( Fig. 2d-f ) and minimum SLP (Extended Data Fig. 2d-f ) for each ensemble member of the pre-industrial, historical and RCP8.5 simulations. We found that climate change at the time of the event weakly and insignificantly (P = 0.05) influenced the intensity of hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3 ), corresponding to similar ensemble spreads between the pre-industrial and historical simulations ( Fig. 2d-f ). On the other hand, hurricanes like Katrina, Irma and Maria are expected to significantly (P = 0.05) intensify with continued warming (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3 ), corresponding to a shift towards greater intensities for the RCP8.5 simulations compared to the historical ( Fig. 2d-f) .\nWe extended the investigation to 15 tropical cyclone events sampled globally under three future climate scenarios, to address the robustness of the results. We performed the same analysis for all 15 tropical cyclones as was presented above for hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria, including an evaluation of the historical hindcast's ability to reproduce the observed tropical cyclone track. Of the 45 experiments, four were discarded for tropical cyclone tracks that deviated substantially from the historical case (Methods). Of the 15 tropical cyclones, 13 of which were intense, 11 show significant (P = 0.05) intensity increases, regardless of emissions scenario, with peak wind speed increases of 6-29 knots and minimum SLP reduced by 5-25 hPa (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Changes are insignificant for hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, and hurricane Bob significantly weakens. Therefore, the experiments provide substantial support for strengthening of intense tropical cyclone events globally for the three future climate scenarios considered.\nFinally, we quantified the uncertainty in the response of tropical cyclones to anthropogenic forcings owing to convective parameterization using simulations of hurricane Katrina at resolutions of 3 km, 9 km and 27 km. Regardless of resolution, these simulations produced insignificant changes in Katrina's intensity from the pre-industrial to historical climates, and a substantial and significant (P = 0.05) increase in intensity from the historical to RCP8.5 climates (Fig. 2d and Table 1 Article reSeArcH anthropogenic forcing may be insensitive to use of convective parameterization and model resolution between 3 km and 27 km in this model, with additional work needed to make a generalized conclusion.

We analysed anthropogenic changes in rainfall within a reference frame centred on the tropical cyclone, called a 'composite' (Fig. 3) , because even small changes in tropical cyclone track and translation speed confound a geographically fixed analysis. The composites include the simulated tropical cyclone lifetime, excluding a generous 12-h spin-up, and cover ocean and land. Two levels of statistical significance (P = 0.05 and P = 0.10) are presented, as changes in rainfall tend to be noisy compared with wind speed and SLP. We found that climate change at the time of Katrina significantly (P = 0.10) enhanced rainfall rates by 4%-9% over an approximately 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 box centred on the tropical cyclone, a result qualitatively insensitive to model resolution and use of convective parameterization (Table 2) .

Therefore, we find evidence that climate change so far has begun to enhance rainfall for these three tropical cyclones, with investigation of additional cases needed before making a general conclusion.

The largest increases in rainfall tend to occur over the regions of heaviest historical rainfall (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4 ). For some tropical cyclones, including hurricanes Irma and Maria (Fig. 3) , there is a coherent spatial pattern in the future rainfall response characterized by drying in the outer-tropical-cyclone radii, resulting in rainfall responses that are stronger over an approximately 1.5\u00b0 \u00d7 1.5\u00b0 area compared with a 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 box (Table 2) . Such outer-tropical-cyclone drying is not apparent or is weak for most tropical cyclones considered, including hurricanes Katrina, Floyd, Gafilo and Yasi (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4) . The future rainfall changes reach 25%-30% for some tropical cyclones under an RCP8.5 scenario (Table 2) , exceeding what would be expected by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling alone given regional SST warming of about 2.5 \u00b0C in these cases.\nWe next evaluated changes in extreme rainfall, which can be important for localized flooding, by considering the probability density functions of rainfall rates sampled three-hourly and including each model grid point within about 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 centred on the tropical cyclone for the lifetime of the simulated storm (Fig. 4) .

We have improved our understanding of anthropogenic influences on tropical cyclones by quantifying how the intensity and rainfall of historically impactful tropical cyclone events could change if similar events occurred in cooler and warmer climates, using ten-member ensembles of convection-permitting hindcast simulations with boundary conditions adjusted to reflect the different climate states. We found that climate change so far has weakly and insignificantly influenced the wind speed and SLP-based intensities for hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria, suggesting the possibility that climate variability-rather than anthropogenic warming-may have driven the active 2005 and 2017 Atlantic hurricane seasons, which were indeed characterized by especially warm tropical Atlantic SSTs. However, climate change at the time of these hurricanes significantly enhanced rainfall by 4%-9% and increased the probability of extreme rainfall rates, suggesting that climate change to date has already begun to increase tropical cyclone rainfall. Investigation of additional tropical cyclones is needed before making a general conclusion. We then considered how 15 tropical cyclone events sampled globally could change if similar events were to occur at the end of the twentyfirst century under the RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. We found a substantial and significant future intensification in the majority (11 of 13) of intense tropical cyclone events, based on wind speed and SLP, consistent with maximum potential intensity theory. Analysis of SST and tropical tropopause temperature changes is planned to understand the physical mechanisms behind these responses. In addition, we found robust increases in future tropical cyclone rainfall, with some events exceeding what would be expected by Clausius-Clapeyron alone and some events demonstrating a spatial pattern with concentrated rainfall increases near the centre of the tropical cyclone and drying in the outer-tropical-cyclone radii. These future changes in tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall could exacerbate societal impacts associated with ocean wind-waves 45 , storm surge, flooding, and forests and ecosystems 46 . Simulations with and without convective parameterization suggest that convective parameterization introduces minimal uncertainty into the sign of projected changes in tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall, supporting confidence in projections of tropical cyclone activity from models with both parameterized convection and tropical-cyclone-permitting resolution (less than 0.25\u00b0).\nThe detection and attribution of anthropogenic changes in tropical cyclone events is a rapidly emerging science and methodology 47 , especially as supercomputing advances enable ensembles of convection-permitting simulations. Our use of a dynamical climate model allows us to perform controlled experiments that focus on specific events and include various complexities of relevant physical processes. One important physical process for tropical cyclones that is missing from our model design is atmosphere-ocean coupling. In reality, tropical cyclone winds typically induce a 'cold wake' of upper-ocean temperatures that can provide a negative feedback on tropical cyclone intensity, depending on the tropical cyclone's intensity and translation speed and the ocean heat content and salinity structure 40, 48, 49 . Therefore, lack of coupling in the model can lead to tropical cyclones that are more intense and frequent compared to slab-ocean and fully coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations 50, 51 . The atmosphere-only simulations presented in this study may overestimate tropical cyclone intensity, and additional research would help to quantify this uncertainty. In addition, because we used a single climate model, we have not examined model structural uncertainty, and results from other convection-permitting models could vary from those presented here."}, {"section_title": "Online content", "text": "Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0673-2."}, {"section_title": "METhods", "text": "We performed hindcast simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model 52 version 3.8.1, which is developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The regional model is well suited for this study for several reasons. First, the use of lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) allows us to prescribe a tighter constraint on the large-scale circulation (that is, steering flow) of the tropical cyclone hindcast than if a global model were used. This is beneficial because it is necessary for the hindcasts to reproduce observed tropical cyclone tracks well, given that tropical cyclone characteristics such as intensity and rainfall are sensitive to underlying SST and surrounding environmental conditions. In addition, such 'well behaved' tracks among different climate scenarios enables a 'fair' comparison of the tropical cyclone responses. That is, a simulated tropical cyclone that deviates substantially from the observed track does not truly represent that tropical cyclone. (We typically used a criterion of about 3\u00b0 of latitude or longitude, with some subjective judgement.) Second, whereas global climate models typically use the hydrostatic approximation to simplify the vertical momentum equation, WRF is non-hydrostatic and therefore more appropriate for simulating small-scale convective processes. Finally, the regional domain allows us to perform ensembles of simulations at convection-permitting resolution, which would be computationally less feasible with a global model.\nThe control simulations consist of hindcasts representing 15 tropical cyclone events ( Fig. 1 Table 1 ) was chosen to represent the tropical cyclone for as much of its lifetime as possible, while still being able to realistically simulate the observed track, since an earlier initialization time generally produced larger deviations between the observed and simulated tropical cyclone track. The tropical cyclone intensity within the model adjusts from its initial condition within hours. We did not test whether the simulated anthropogenic influence on tropical cyclones is sensitive to initialization time. SST was prescribed from the daily 0.25\u00b0 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Optimum Interpolation (NOAA-OI) dataset 55 for all tropical cyclones, except hurricanes Irma and Maria, which used the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2. Greenhouse gas concentrations, including CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O, CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl 4 , were prescribed according to refs 56, 57 . A ten-member ensemble of each simulation was generated using the Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter Scheme (SKEBS) 58 , which represents uncertainty from interactions with unresolved scales by introducing temporally and spatially correlated perturbations to the rotational wind components and potential temperature. The SST, initial condition and LBCs are identical for each ensemble member within a simulation set.\nWe also performed experiments representing hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria if they were to occur in a pre-industrial climate and all 15 tropical cyclone events at the end of the twenty-first century under the RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, as permitted by supercomputing resources. SSTs, initial conditions and LBCs for the pre-industrial and Representative Concentration Pathway experiments were based on those from the historical simulations, with adjustments to remove and add, respectively, the thermodynamic component of anthropogenic climate change, using the 'pseudo-global warming' approach detailed in refs 47, 59 . In the pseudo-global warming experiments, the model's boundary conditions use the same input data as in the control simulations for the historical period, but with a climate change signal added. This methodology has been used to study anthropogenic influences on individual tropical cyclone events at similar horizontal resolutions used in this study [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . The novelty here is in investigating over a dozen tropical cyclone cases under multiple emissions scenarios at such a resolution. The variables adjusted in the LBCs include temperature, relative humidity and geopotential height. We did not adjust horizontal winds in the LBCs to minimize possible perturbations to the simulated hurricane track, although tests on a subset of simulations showed that the response in tropical cyclone intensity to anthropogenic forcing is insensitive to whether circulation changes were applied to the LBCs. The experimental design, therefore, prescribes no changes in large-scale vertical wind shear. We note that any potential changes in vertical wind shear 43 may be expected to change the summary statistics of tropical cyclone activity (for example, average annual number of tropical cyclones). However, even given average changes in wind shear, it is conceivable that individual tropical cyclone events may occur under shear conditions similar to those of the present climate, especially since some climate models project relatively weak shear changes in the Atlantic and Pacific basins 66 . Therefore, by prescribing zero change in horizontal winds in the climate change simulations, the large-scale vertical shear state is included in the conditionality of the 'worst-case-scenario' tropical cyclone event occurrence. This allows us to evaluate changes in tropical cyclone magnitudes given similar shear conditions, which may become more or less likely in changing climates.\nThe variables adjusted in the initial conditions include surface temperature (land and sea), 2-m air temperature, 2-m specific humidity, SLP and surface pressure. Greenhouse gas concentrations were modified in the WRF climate model according to refs 56, 57, 67 . The experimental design is similar to the hindcast methodology used to understand anthropogenic contributions to the extreme flood event that affected the Boulder, Colorado, region in September 2013 Anthropogenic climate change for the end of the twenty-first century was based on simulations from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) of the CMIP5. The climate change perturbation for the RCP8.5 hurricane Katrina experiment was calculated as the 2081-2100 August climatology from the CCSM4 RCP8.5 simulation minus the 1980-2000 August climatology from the CCSM4 historical simulation. This perturbation was then added to the historical boundary conditions. The perturbations for all other tropical cyclones were calculated in the same way, but for the month in which the tropical cyclone occurred (for example, September for hurricanes Irma and Maria).\nBy using one global model to provide climate change perturbations, the results here apply for the climate sensitivity characteristic of that model. The uncertainty due to the range of climate sensitivities among different models was not accounted for, in favour of using supercomputing resources towards 15 tropical cyclone events, convection-permitting resolution, ten-member ensembles and multiple Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios. We note that the climate sensitivity of the CCSM4 model is among the lower of the coupled atmosphereocean global climate models of CMIP5 70, 71 , suggesting that the estimates of future change provided by this study may be conservative. The SST forcings for the CAM simulations from the C20C+ D&A Project were based on the multi-model mean of the CMIP5, suggesting that the estimates of climate change influences from pre-industrial to present are near the centre of the range of models.\nSimulations of all tropical cyclone events were performed at a convectionpermitting horizontal resolution of 4.5 km, with 44 levels in the vertical and a model top at 20 hPa. To investigate uncertainty in the response of tropical cyclones to anthropogenic forcings due to convective parameterization, we performed additional simulations of hurricane Katrina at horizontal resolutions of 3 km without parameterization, 9 km both without and with parameterization (Kain-Fritsch), and 27 km with parameterization, with 35 levels in the vertical and a model top at 50 hPa. The results are insensitive to vertical resolution and model top choices.\nSimulated tropical cyclone coordinates are defined using the location of minimum SLP. Simulated three-hourly instantaneous maximum 10-m tropical cyclone wind speeds are compared with the observed six-hourly maximum 1-min average sustained 10-m wind speed from the Revised Hurricane Database (HURDAT2 72, 73 ) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) dataset as archived in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS 74 ) v03r10 database. Such differences in maximum wind speed definitions generate uncertainty in comparisons between observations and model simulations, and it is unclear whether there is a tendency for one definition to be systematically biased in a particular direction. The historical simulations appear to produce tropical cyclones with slightly weaker intensities than observed (Fig. 1) , which may be related to these differences in intensity definitions between the model and observations, or to model limitations in horizontal resolution and/or physical approximations. Despite this uncertainty, the simulations with convection-permitting resolution perform substantially better in reproducing the approximate tropical cyclone intensities than simulations with convective parameterization (Fig. 3d) . In addition, we acknowledge that while climate models are imperfect, the robust climate change response for hurricane Katrina at horizontal resolutions between"}]
