Heat stress is characterized by changes in respiration, heart rate, sweating, blood chemistry, and hormones. It can also alter the metabolism of minerals and water and the digestion of nutrients. Animals generally increase their water intake and reduce their feed intake. Depending on the species, heat stress can reduce meat and milk production and lower animal reproduction rates. Livestock producers can mitigate heat stress with shade structures, cooling systems, or altered feed, but these methods increase production and capital costs. Dairy cows are particularly sensitive to heat stress; higher temperatures lower milk output as well as its fat, solids, lactose, and protein content.\nThe U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) recognizes that increased heat stress will increase livestock production costs, lower feed efficiency, and compromise livestock health. While the physiological and production responses to heat stress have been widely studied, there have been no attempts to quantify the costs to the U.S. dairy industry of climate change-induced heat stress. In this report, we use operation-level economic data coupled with finely scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects U.S. dairies' effectiveness at producing outputs with a given level of inputs.

In 2010, heat stress lowered the value of annual milk production for the average dairy by about $39,000, which equates to $1.2 billion in lost production for the entire dairy sector.\nClimate model predictions indicate that, on average, U.S. dairies will experience an annual temperature increase between 1.45 and 2.37 degrees Fahrenheit by 2030. Assuming no adjustments in milk prices, we estimate that the additional heat stress from climate change will in 2030:\n\u2022 Lower milk production for the average dairy by 0.60 to 1.35 percent, depending on the climate model used;\n\u2022 Cause some production loss to almost all dairies, with 4 to 18 percent of dairies experiencing a loss greater than 2 percent;\n\u2022 Lower total annual production at the State level between 0.05 percent and 4.4 percent, with the greatest losses occurring in Southern States; and\n\u2022 Lower receipts from total annual milk production at the national level by $79-$199 million, at 2010 prices.\nAllowing for higher market prices resulting from the contraction in milk production, we estimate that additional climate change-induced heat stress will in 2030:\n\u2022 Lower consumer welfare by $64-$162 million because of higher milk prices, and\n\u2022 Lower producer welfare by $42-$108 million because of higher production costs.\nAllowing for a continuation of past trends in dairy location and scale of production does not substantially alter the magnitude of the estimated effects of climate-induced heat stress on dairy production. Production effects in the study were mitigated only slightly if dairies moved out of regions forecast to undergo the greatest increases in heat stress, because dairies in these regions contribute relatively little to national output.\nWhile the estimated reductions in output are modest over the next 20 years, losses from heat stress could increase substantially in later decades, depending on the extent of future climate changes. However, there is potential scope for adaptation to future climate change. Because the effects of climate change-induced heat stress will likely increase gradually over time, costs can be mitigated by research and development into heat mitigation technologies and practices. Possible innovations include energy-efficient cooling for animal housing, the adoption of heat-tolerant breeds, and improvements in scientific knowledge about the interactions among feed, nutrition, and heat stress."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "This report uses operation-level economic data and finely scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects the technical efficiency of U.S. dairies.

For livestock, climate change could affect the costs and returns of production by altering (1) the price and availability of feed crops, (2) the location and productivity of pasture and rangeland, (3) the distribution of livestock parasites and pathogens, and (4) the thermal environment of animals-thereby affecting animal health, reproduction, and the efficiency with which livestock convert feed into retained products (especially meat and milk). This report evaluates the potential economic implications of climate change acting through this fourth mechanism, focusing on U.S. dairies -the livestock sector most affected by heat stress.\nIn many parts of the United States, climate change is likely to result in higher average temperatures, hotter daily maximums, and more frequent heat waves -all of which could increase thermal stress for livestock. Thermal stress reduces meat and milk production and lowers animal reproduction rates. Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress -including modifications to animal management or housing -tend to increase production costs. According to the most recent assessment report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program: \"The projected increases in air temperatures will negatively affect confined animal operations (dairy, beef, and swine) located in the central United States, increasing production costs as a result of reductions in performance associated with lower feed intake and increased requirements for energy to maintain healthy livestock\" (USGCRP, 2009). Despite such forecasts, no studies have estimated these potential heat stressrelated costs at the national level.\nThis report provides estimates of the relationship between the thermal environment and the productivity of U.S. dairies in order to provide information about the potential implications of climate change-induced heat stress for the livestock industry. The analysis focuses on dairies because dairy cows are particularly sensitive to heat stress, and the dairy sector has been estimated to bear 53 to 64 percent of the costs of heat stress to the livestock industry (St-Pierre et al., 2003) .\nFirst, we estimate the current average heat load for livestock throughout the United States using historical daily weather data. We match this climate information with farm production data drawn from nationally representative surveys of U.S. dairies conducted in 2005 and 2010. We then estimate the relationship between the current average heat load and dairy productivity using an econometric production model. Results from this model provide cross-sectional information about how much milk output declines as heat loads increase.\nNext, we use forecasts from four global climate models to provide a range of predicted heat loads in different U.S. regions in 2030. Using these climate forecasts and estimates from the econometric production model, we forecast the potential milk production losses associated with climate change. We explore how the magnitude of the production effects varies across States. We also explore how these effects would differ if regional growth patterns in milk output were to follow historical trends or if production were to shift from regions experiencing relatively large increases in temperature to regions experiencing smaller increases.\nResults of the econometric production model indicate a robust statistically significant negative relationship between average heat stress and milk output. Depending on the climate model used, the results imply that the additional heat stress caused by global warming could reduce milk production for the average U.S. dairy by about 0.60 to 1.35 percent per year in 2030, with larger declines predicted for dairies in the South. The total U.S. annual welfare costs of climate change-induced heat stress in dairies range between an estimated $106 million and $269 million. These results assume producers have a limited ability to respond to climate change through adoption of new technologies, genetic improvements, or relocation to cooler regions. Consequently, these estimates can be considered an upper bound on the effects of climate change-induced heat stress.\nWhile the estimated reductions in dairy output are relatively modest over the next 20 years, temperature increases are predicted to be larger in subsequent years, which could result in substantially larger losses from heat stress. In addition, this report considers the potential costs of heat stress only and not climate-related costs resulting from higher prices for feed crops, reduced productivity of pasture and rangeland, or the increased prevalence of livestock parasites and pathogens. "}, {"section_title": "Heat Stress and Dairy Productivity", "text": "Depending on environmental conditions (humidity, wind speed, radiation, etc.), every animal has a thermoneutral zone-an optimal range of temperatures in which it can maintain a normal body temperature without altering its behavior or physiological functions. Above these temperatures, an animal may experience changes in respiration rate, heart rate, sweating, blood chemistry, and hormones (Fuquay, 1981; Kadzere et al., 2002; St-Pierre et al., 2003) . Heat stress can also affect the animals' metabolism of minerals and water as well as nutrient digestibility. Behaviorally, animals under heat stress generally increase their water intake and reduce their feed intake. Depending on the species, the thermoregulatory responses to heat stress can reduce livestock productivity.\nBecause of the high metabolic heat production associated with rumen fermentation and lactation, dairy cattle are particularly sensitive to heat stress. In dairy cows, higher temperatures lower milk output and reduce the percentages of fat, solids, lactose, and protein in milk (Kadzere et al., 2002; St-Pierre et al., 2003; West, 2003) . Heat stress also reduces the fertility of cattle and dairy cows, reducing reproduction rates."}, {"section_title": "Heat Stress and Other Livestock Species", "text": "While some breeds of beef cattle are less susceptible to heat stress than common dairy cow breeds, beef cattle generally have similar physiological responses to heat stress. In beef cattle, heat stress has been observed to decrease dry matter intake and reduce the rate of weight gain (Lippke, 1975; Ray, 1989; Mitlohner et al., 2001 ).\nSwine productivity is also susceptible to warm temperatures and high humidity. Heat stress can lower conception rates and result in fewer viable embryos (Edwards et al., 1968; Wettemann and Bazer, 1984) . Sows farrowing during the summer months may have smaller litters and lighter weaning weights than those farrowing during cooler months (Omtvedt et al., 1971 .) High temperatures can also lower the feed intake, weight gain, and feed efficiency of swine (Lopez et al., 1991; Nienaber et al., 1989; Collin et al., 2001 ).\nIn chickens, heat stress has been shown to lower feed intake and weight gain (Cooper and Washburn, 1998; Yalcin et al., 2001; Quinteiro-Filho et al., 2010; Sohail et al., 2012) . Heat stress is also associated with undesirable meat characteristics in broilers (Sandercock et al., 2001; Imik et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) . Studies have shown high temperatures lower laying performance, causing decreases in egg weight and shell thickness (Bogin et al., 1996) . Extreme heat stress also increases bird mortality rates (Bogin et al., 1996; De Basilio et al., 2001 ).\nLivestock productivity may also decline at temperatures below the thermoneutral zone, as livestock must expend more energy and increase their voluntary feed intake in order to maintain their core temperature, resulting in lower feed efficiency (NRC, 1981) . This can be an important factor influencing the design of housing and in husbandry decisions for cold-susceptible animals such as poultry, swine, and young animals. Dairy cows are relatively cold-tolerant animals, and potential productivity costs associated with low temperatures are not considered in this report. "}, {"section_title": "Mitigating Heat Stress on the Farm", "text": "To combat heat stress, farmers can make both longrun and shortrun production decisions. Operators can invest in durable assets (e.g., shade structures and cooling systems) to mitigate the effects of expected heat stress. Operators can also respond, within a particular year, to acute heat spikes by running cooling equipment more or adjusting the quantity/quality of feed rations.\nProducers of dairy and beef cattle can mitigate heat stress by providing trees, buildings, or portable structures for shade. For grazing animals, trees surpass buildings in terms of better ventilation, less reflection of solar rays, and natural cooling through evapotranspiration (Brantly, 2013) . Shade in combination with cooling (spray and fans) has been shown to offset decreases in milk production and reproductive efficiency resulting from heat stress (Armstrong, 1994) . Cows that were cooled with sprinkling and ventilation were found to consume more food and less water and to increase milk, fat, and protein production (Flamenbaum et al., 1995; Her et al., 1998; Igono et al., 1987) .\nFarmers' efforts to cool cows using ventilation will likely be reflected in energy use. Altering feed rations can also reduce the effect of heat stress on dairy and beef cattle. Heat stress substantially increases the energy required for physiological maintenance, reducing the energy available for meat or milk production. At the same time, heat stress induces cattle to reduce their feed "}, {"section_title": "Energy expenditures per unit increase in warmer climates", "text": "Notes: The heat stress load for each dairy is based on the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) load (measured in humidity-adjusted degree hours) corresponding to the location of the dairy: Low (THI load<4,000); Medium (4,000 \u2264 THI load < 12,000); High (12,000 \u2264 THI load).

To compensate for these changes, dietary recommendations include increasing the nutritional quality of forages, lowering fiber content, and increasing fat levels and digestibility of feed (West, 1997) . Other recommendations include altering feeding times to coincide with the cooler times of the day and reducing the effort required by animals to access food, minerals, and water.\nA possible adaptive response to a warming climate is to select cross dairy breeds to take advantage of the relative vigor of first-generation crosses (McDowell et al., 1996) . Another option is to switch to breeds of cattle that are better suited to high temperatures. For example, Sharma et al. (1983) found that Jerseys were more resistant to heat stress in terms of milk production than Holsteins. The 2010 ARMS data show that Jersey cows were more common on dairies located in warmer regions ( fig. 2 ). For all three dairy size categories, dairies in the highest heat load regions have the greatest share of Jersey cows in their herds, suggesting breed selection is being used to cope with heat stress."}, {"section_title": "Benefits and Costs of Mitigating Heat Stress", "text": "Producers can mitigate the negative effects of heat stress (lower revenue from less output) by increasing the quantity or quality of feed, using more electricity for cooling, or updating cooling equipment. Because these options are costly, producers must weigh the additional revenues that can be earned from heat stress mitigation against the mitigation costs. This tradeoff can be illustrated graphically ( fig. 3 ).\nThe upper solid curve in the figure shows the total revenue earned for different levels of the heat stress"}, {"section_title": "Heat Stress Mitigation and Other Livestock Species", "text": "Heat mitigation strategies for hogs and pigs often emphasize barn design and ventilation, since most U.S. swine are raised indoors. Ventilation can be combined with intermittent sprinkler systems that wet the animal and allow the moisture to evaporate (Hahn, 1985) . Evaporative cooling units use the heat from the air to vaporize water, which cools the surrounding air as it evaporates. Other options include air conditioning units, fresh air vents, additional insulation near roofs, and larger attic spaces for better ventilation (Guthrie, 2011) .\nOther strategies to mitigate heat stress in swine include reducing the stocking density in barns. Animals generate heat through their metabolism, so lowering the density can reduce the amount of heat generated in the barn. In addition, high-density stocking may not allow pigs to extend their frames to maximize heat loss or permit sufficient ventilation around their bodies.\nAs with swine, most chickens and turkeys in the United States are raised in buildings, so strategies to reduce heat stress are similar. Housing should be designed to promote good ventilation and air movement. Houses with tunnel ventilation or ventilation fans, sprinklers, or evaporative cooling are recommended in hot regions (University of Kentucky, 2013) . Stocking density in houses should be limited so as to not exceed the capacity of the ventilation system. High density adds more metabolic heat to the house, increases radiant heat transfer from bird to bird, and traps more hot air between birds.\nOther heat stress mitigation practices in poultry include nutritional supplements for feed or water to maintain the electrolyte balance of the birds. Dietary adjustments include offering feed with higher nutrient concentrations and increased energy content. Since heat is generated during digestion, another approach is to withdraw feed prior to peak daily temperatures (Butcher and Miles, 2013) .

In this example, mitigation costs grow at an increasing rate. Net revenues are the distance between the revenue line and the mitigation cost line. The optimal level of heat stress mitigation M* is the point where net revenues are maximized-where the distance between the lines is greatest. Below M*, the additional revenues from increasing mitigation outweigh the additional costs of mitigation, and above M*, the costs of additional mitigation outweigh the additional benefits. Hence, it is not economically optimal to mitigate all heat stress because the costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA includes southern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida). A similar pattern emerges for hogs, which have a slightly higher threshold than dairy cows. In contrast, poultry have a much higher THI threshold (bottom map) as shown by lack of regions having more than 1,000 degree days above the threshold (the darker shades on the maps). This may partly explain the greater concentration of poultry production, relative to dairy or hog production, in the Southern States.\nIn general, livestock production is concentrated in climates that expose animals to less heat stress. This can be seen by comparing the share of animals and the share of land in different heat load categories ( fig. 7) . For example, in the case of dairies (top chart), most of the \"cooler\" heat load categories (THI loads between 50 and 400 humidity-adjusted degree days) contain a higher percentage of cows than land. 5 In fact, about 28 percent of all dairy cows are located in the second lowest heat load category (between 50 and 100 humidity-adjusted degree days), compared to about 16 percent of all land. In contrast, most of the \"warmer\" categories (THI loads greater than 400) contain a lower percentage of cows than land. Hogs and poultry show a similar pattern.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA USDA Regional Climate Hubs. 14 Milk production losses, by State, range from 0.05 percent to 4.4 percent, depending on the climate model. Production in several States in the Southern Plains and Southeast (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas), as well as in Missouri, are predicted to decline by more than 2 percent by at least one climate model. For individual States, there is substantial variation across models in predicted effects, reflecting differences in climate change predictions across the GCMs (Malcolm et al., 2012) . 15 Nonetheless, States in the Southern Plains and Southeast are predicted to experience the largest percentage declines in milk production, generally corresponding to the proportional increase in THI load ( fig. 8 )."}, {"section_title": "Cost Estimates of Heat Stress in Livestock Highest for Dairy", "text": "Heat stress will impose different costs on different livestock sectors, depending on the species resistance to heat stress, the costs of mitigating heat, and the location of production. St-Pierre, Cobanov, and Schnitkey (2003) estimated the costs of heat stress for several livestock categories (table 1) . The authors compared animal performance, reproduction, and mortality in the current (2002) climate to a hypothetical \"ideal\" climate in which livestock are always in their thermoneutral zone. They define the cost of heat stress as the gross value of lost production plus expenditures on heat mitigation. Using a model that relies on experimental data linking livestock productivity to heat stress, assumptions about producers' heat mitigation expenditures, and prices of outputs, St-Pierre, Cobanov, and Schnitkey estimated that for all major U.S. livestock industries, heat stress imposes annual costs between $1.69 billion and $2.36 billion (in 2002 dollars).\nThe dairy sector exhibited the largest losses from heat stress (53.0-63.9 percent of total losses, depending on level of mitigation). Dairy cows are particularly sensitive to heat stress because of the heat generated by milk production and rumen fermentation (Kadzere et al., 2002) . Lactation in highyielding milk cows requires large quantities of feed. The process of metabolizing nutrients generates heat, which must be dissipated in a warm climate to maintain normal physiological functioning. The remaining shares of livestock losses from heat stress are in the beef (15.7-21.9 percent), swine (13.3-17.7 percent), and poultry (7.0-7.5 percent) sectors."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Climate Change, Heat Stress, and U."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change and Heat Stress", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Measuring Heat Loads", "text": "Understanding how heat stress varies across the country and how it might change in the future requires a method for relating climatic characteristics (i.e., temperature and humidity) to heat stress. An upper critical temperature can be used to define when an animal reaches the limit of its thermoneutral zone and begins to exhibit heat stress. For example, the upper critical temperature for dairy cattle is usually given as 25-26 \u00b0C (77-79) (Berman et al., 1985) . However, other environmental factors-particularly humidity-will affect the temperature at which an animal experiences heat stress. The temperature humidity index (THI), a combined measure of ambient temperature and relative humidity, has been shown to better quantify thermal stress on livestock than temperature alone (Ravagnolo et al., 2000) . The THI is calculated as:\n(1) THI = (dry bulb temperature \u00b0C) + (0.36 \u00d7 dew point temperature \u00b0C) + 41.2.\nThe upper critical THI above which animals suffer from heat stress varies by species and age. This THI threshold has been estimated to be about 70 humidity-adjusted degrees for lactating dairy cows, 72 degrees for growing-finishing hogs, 75 degrees for beef cows, and 78 degrees for broiler chickens (St-Pierre et al., 2003) .\nThe THI load provides a measure of the amount of heat stress an animal is under (St-Pierre et al., 2003) . The THI load (measured in humidity-adjusted degree hours or days) increases with the duration and extent that an animal in a particular location is above its critical THI threshold. The annual THI load is roughly analogous to \"cooling degree days,\" a concept often used to convey the amount of energy needed to cool a building in the summer. 1\nCalculation of the THI load for 1 day can be illustrated graphically ( fig. 4) . The solid sinusoidal line represents the THI as it fluctuates over 24 hours. The critical THI threshold is indicated by the horizontal line THI. The THI load is shown as the shaded area in the figure. The THI load can increase with higher temperatures or higher humidity, with more time spent above the threshold, or with a lower critical THI threshold (implying the animal is more sensitive to heat). Given a species-specific THI threshold value, and assuming the THI is a sinusoidal function and that the minimum temperature can be used to approximate the dew point, it is possible to estimate the daily THI load using only the minimum and maximum temperatures (see Key and Sneeringer, 2014 , for more details about calculating the THI load using weather data).\nThe THI load is generally highest in the South and in the summer months ( fig. 5) . 2 In the vast majority of the country, dairy cows experienced no heat stress (they were below their THI threshold) from November through April. In all but the most mountainous regions, dairy cows experienced some heat stress during July and August.

The PRISM data are generated by interpolating between weather stations to generate weather variable estimates for each 4km grid cell in the United States. 4 We use the daily weather data from 1990 to 2005 to calculate the THI load for each day and then add the daily THI loads in each year to derive the annual THI load. Variations in the weather from year to year could cause the THI load in any one year to differ from the average or expected weather-that is, the climate. Consequently, to characterize the climate for each 4km cell, we average the 1990-2005 annual THI loads to derive the average annual THI load. Figure 6 illustrates the range of average annual THI loads in the contiguous 48 States for dairy cows, hogs, and poultry (using critical THI thresholds of 70, 72, and 78 humidity-adjusted degrees, respectively). Not surprisingly, the THI load is greatest in the South and lowest in the North and the mountainous regions.

For this, we use climate forecasts from four General Circulation Models (GCMs), which estimate patterns of temperature and precipitation based on assumptions about future carbon emissions levels. For this analysis, we use the A1B greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC, 2007) . This \"medium\" emissions scenario incorporates a variety of midrange assumptions about future population growth, technological change, economic growth, international political cooperation, and the like. While emissions levels in the distant future are highly uncertain, there is relatively little variation between the scenarios before 2050 (Jones et al., 2009 ). Since our analysis focuses on 2030, it is unlikely that an alternative GHG emissions scenario would substantially change the outcomes.\nThe GCMs used in this study are listed in table 2. GCMs model the atmosphere in stacks of cells at a course spatial and temporal resolution. Because of this, the three-dimensional GCM output usually must be \"downscaled\" to finer-scale two-dimensional data in order to study the impacts of climate change on natural systems.

To quantify this relationship, we econometrically estimate the relationship between output (milk) and inputs (labor, feed, capital, and other inputs), controlling for characteristics of the dairy operation and operator. Importantly, we allow input productivity to vary according to the THI load-higher THI loads cause lower rates of weight gain and milk production, holding inputs constant. More specifically, we estimate how the THI load affects technical efficiency-how much output is actually produced relative to what could be produced if all inputs were used efficiently.\nThe concept of technical efficiency and how it changes with the heat load can be explained graphically ( fig. 9 ). The upward sloping curve represents a hypothetical production frontier-the most output y (e.g., milk) that could be produced given a quantity of an input x (e.g., feed) if the input were used efficiently-that is, using the best available production practices in optimal climate. In fact, most operations are not perfectly efficient, so actual production falls below the frontier.\nThe figure shows two farms located in different climates. Suppose both farms use the same amount of the input x 0 and the farm in a cooler region produces y cool , while the farm in the warmer region produces a smaller amount, y warm . Both farms are inefficient because their output falls below Temperature Humidity Index load for one day the maximum amount that could be produced, y*. This inefficiency is shown in the figure as the distance between what is produced and the production frontier.\nTechnical efficiency (TE) is a measure of farmers' ability to effectively use the available production technology. It is defined as the ratio of what is actually produced to what could be produced if operating perfectly efficiently. Because more is produced in the cool region compared to the warm region using the same inputs, the farm in the cool region is more technically efficient: Combining ARMS data with supplemental price information, we estimate farm labor, feed, and capital costs. 8 Off-farm wage data from another version of the ARMS are used to estimate the opportunity costs of unpaid labor hours used on the farm. USDA market price data are used to value the reported quantities of homegrown feed and forages fed to dairy cows. ERS researchers also produce annualized estimates of the cost of replacing the capital used for cattle housing, milking facilities, feed storage structures, manure handling/storage structures, feed handling equipment, tractors, trucks, and purchased dairy herd replacements, plus the interest that the remaining capital could have earned in an alternative use.\nMilk, which represents about 87 percent of the total value of production for the dairy operations in the sample, is the output in the production function. Inputs include milk cows (average herd size), feed (cost), capital (replacement cost for all buildings and machinery), labor (hours), and other inputs (expenditures on medicine and veterinary services, marketing, custom work, repairs, agricul-"}, {"section_title": "19", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Climate Change, Heat Stress, and U.S. Dairy Production, ERR-175", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA tural chemicals, fuel, and energy). Feed consists of mixes, forage, and grains of varying quality and digestibility, which we aggregate into a single input.\nEach dairy in the ARMS is linked to daily, pixel-level climate data using the centroid of the ZIP Code in which the dairy is located. The main variable of interest is the longrun average THI load, which is hypothesized to lower technical efficiency by reducing an animal's output for a given level of inputs. In addition to the longrun THI load, we include a measure of the deviation of the current THI load from the longrun average THI load: A simple comparison of the characteristics of dairies in different climates suggests an inverse relationship between productivity and THI load (table 4). Larger dairies are over-represented in warmer regions, which results in a positive correlation between size and THI load. To account for this, we compare productivity measures across three levels of THI load using three size categories based on hundredweight of milk produced. 10 Operations in areas with the highest THI loads produce less milk per cow than operations in regions with the lowest THI loads, for all three size categories. Cow mortality rates generally increase with THI load. For medium and large dairy operations (which produce about 85 percent of U.S. milk output), unit costs are higher in the warmest regions compared to the coolest region.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA fig. 9 for an illustration of these concepts).\nThe results indicate that larger operation size and greater specialization in the dairy enterprise are associated with higher efficiency. Also, higher operator's age is associated with a decrease in efficiency, implying that younger farmers are more efficient. While age is significant, the number of years the operation has been producing milk has no statistically significant effect on efficiency. Operator age may be a better predictor of the vintage of the production technology than years of experience if younger farmers are more likely to invest in and operate newer buildings and machinery. Of greatest interest for this study, the results indicate that typical heat stress (longrun average THI load) is correlated with lower efficiency. The parameter associated with unexpected heat stress (deviation from average THI load) is not statistically significantly different from zero. There may be no significant weather effect because the model includes variables that account for variation in production across regions, and within regions, producers experience similar weather shocks.\nThe effect of the average THI load on inefficiency is about 10 percent larger for the 2010 sample than the 2005 sample. Hence, the estimated effect of average heat stress on efficiency was similar for Stochastic Production Frontier estimates-key coefficients Note: Significant at the 10% (*), 5% (**), and 1% (***) levels. See both surveys despite the fact that only about 6 percent of the dairies appeared in both surveys, and despite changes in average farm size, geographical concentration of production, and production technologies over the 5 years between surveys."}, {"section_title": "Results of Econometric Model", "text": "The stochastic production frontier model consists of two parts: a production frontier (the coefficients indicate the marginal contribution of the inputs to output on the frontier) and inefficiency (the coefficients explain how much the variables cause production to fall below the frontier). In the production frontier equation, the inputs and output are in logarithms, so each coefficient can be interpreted as the percent change in output given a 1-percent change in the input at the sample mean (i.e., the partial output elasticities). All the estimated partial output elasticities-for both 2005 and 2010-are positive (table 5) , which is consistent with economic theory. 9 It is possible that the marginal effect of the THI load increases with the total THI load (i.e., with more extreme heat). We tested this hypothesis by creating a \"high THI load\" and a \"low THI load\" variable, defined as the THI load conditional on the THI being above or below 85 humidity-adjusted degrees. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis (Key and Sneeringer, 2014) . However, we only observe 2 years of data and may not be able to identify the effect on productivity of very rare extreme heat events. 10 On average, both the THI load and productivity increase with the scale of the dairy. Hence, we might observe a spurious positive correlation between THI load and productivity if we don't control adequately for operation size."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Value of Lost Production From Current Heat Stress", "text": "While we are primarily interested in the implications of climate change, it is possible to use the cross-section model to estimate the current (2010) value of lost production because of heat stress. To do so, we predict technical efficiency for each operation when the THI load is zero-i.e., in a hypothetical climate with no heat stress. We then multiply the predicted percentage change in efficiency by current milk production to estimate how production would change, holding everything constant except the THI load.\nUsing the 2010 model parameters, we estimate that heat stress lowers annual milk production for the average dairy farm by about 1,827 cwt, or about $39,100 at 2010 prices. Scaling up using the ARMS sample weights, this is equivalent to $1.20 billion per year in lost production for the entire dairy sector. 11 For context, the sale of milk and other dairy products in the United States totaled $31. "}, {"section_title": "Climate Change Simulations Predicted Effects in 2030", "text": "Using the estimates of the relationship between the average THI load and technical efficiency, we can forecast how production will change because of an increase in average THI load. First, we estimate the percentage change in technical efficiency using the predicted 2030 THI loads and the estimated 2010 model parameters. We then multiply the predicted percentage change in efficiency by 2010 milk production to estimate how milk production would change, holding everything constant except the THI load. This provides an estimate of the production response if there were no change in prices, inputs, technology, or location of production. Later, we explore how the results change if dairy production shifts to cooler regions in response to climate change.\nFor the sample of dairies surveyed in 2010, the average annual temperature is forecast to increase between 1.45 and 2.37 degrees Fahrenheit by 2030, depending on which climate model is used (table  6 ). The THI load is predicted to increase by an average of 1,668-3,945 humidity-adjusted degree hours. The warmer climate is estimated to reduce milk production for the average dairy by 0.60 to 1.35 percent, depending on the climate model (table 6) . For the average dairy, the value of this lost production is between about $2,000 and $5,000 (at 2010 prices). Almost all (99.8 percent) dairies would experience some production loss, and 4 to 18 percent of operations (depending on the climate model) would experience a loss greater than 2 percent. With no market adjustment, the aggregate annual value of this climate change-induced reduction in milk output for the entire U.S. dairy sector is $79 to $199 million (valued at 2010 prices). This represents 6 to 17 percent of the total value of production lost in 2010 because of heat stress ($1.20 billion).\nIn theory, prices should respond to a climate-induced contraction in the milk supply, which would affect costs for producers and consumers. A reduction in output would lead to higher milk prices (lower technical efficiency reduces what can be produced with the same inputs.) Producers would be worse off, despite higher prices, because of their higher production costs. Consumers would also be worse off because they face higher milk prices.\nThe extent of the milk price increase and the magnitude of the welfare losses depend on how responsive consumers and producers are to prices. With a midlevel supply elasticity of 0.75 and relatively inelastic milk demand\u3016(E D = -0.5), the quantity response to the milk supply shift is smaller and the price response is larger compared with a more elastic demand (E D = -1.0) ( (table 6) . 13 With relatively inelastic demand, the value of the total reduction in milk production ranges from $32 million to $81 million, depending on the climate model. For more elastic demand, the range is $46 to $116 million. With relatively inelastic demand, consumers fare worse than producers; with more elastic demand, consumers fare better. Estimates of the total annual welfare losses from climate changeinduced heat stress range from $106 million to $269 million, depending on the climate model.\nTo explore whether some regions are likely to incur greater costs from climate change-induced heat stress, we estimate production losses at the State level ( fig. 10) Total milk production (million cwt) "}, {"section_title": "Alternative Scenarios", "text": "The estimates of the future effects of climate change on technical efficiency assume no changes in available production technologies, producer characteristics, or location of production. In reality, climate change could induce the development of new technologies or shifts in production to regions less affected by climate change. Even without any direct responses to climate change, the size and location of dairy operations are likely to be different in 20 years. First, we explore how the effects of climate change might differ if past trends in farm size and location continue. Then we simulate a hypothetical response to climate change in which production shifts from States experiencing large increases in THI load to States experiencing smaller increases.\nTo project the impact of predicted future THI loads under further consolidation and continued geographic shifts, we use 1992 and 2007 Census of Agriculture data (2007 was the most recent census available at the time this analysis was conducted) to calculate the annual average growth rate in dairy production for every State. We use these State-level growth rates and the 2010 ARMS milk production data to forecast production in every State in 2030. We estimate that by 2030, U.S. milk production will have increased by 38.7 percent and average farm size will have increased by 25.6 percent, relative to 2010 (table 7) .\nTo examine the correlation between predicted production changes and predicted climate change, we sort States into four groups according to their average predicted increase in THI load from 2010 to 2030: Group 1 (THI load increase less than 2,300 humidity-adjusted degree hours), Group 2 (2,300-3,300), Group 3 (3,300-5,000), and Group 4 (more than 5,000 degree hours). The predicted increase in THI load is positively correlated with the current THI load-that is, warmer States are predicted to experience a larger increase in THI load (table 7) . The summary statistics do not show a clear correlation between farm size and THI load or between farm size and predicted change in THI, nor is there an obvious relationship between predicted increase in production and the 2010 THI load or predicted increase in the THI load. Table 7 shows the estimated effect of climate change in 2030 using two different baselines for 2030: (1) 2010 production (also used in table 6), and (2) predicted 2030 production with no climate change and a continuation of industry growth patterns. As expected, the negative efficiency effects are higher in States having a greater predicted increase in THI load. For the average climate prediction (across the four climate models), production in States experiencing the largest increase in THI (Group 4) is predicted to decline by 1.88 percent relative to the 2010 baseline and by 2.02 percent relative to the predicted 2030 baseline with no climate change. In contrast, production in States with the smallest increase in THI load (Group 1) decline by only 0.56 percent and 0.60 percent, respectively. The percentage-point declines in total production (average of all 4 THI groups) relative to the two baselines are almost identical (-0.85 percent and -0.86 percent). Of course, the absolute decline is much larger when the baseline is estimated 2030 production. In sum, we find that a continuation of recent (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) trends in the location and scale of production will not substantially alter the magnitude of the effect of climate-induced heat stress on dairy productivity. Table 7 also illustrates two hypothetical geographical responses to climate change. Scenario 1 illustrates an adaptive response where production moves out of the States experiencing greater increases in heat. Specifically, production is assumed to decrease by 20 percent compared to the predicted 2030 baseline in States that are predicted to have the largest increases in THI load (Groups 3 and 4) and to increase by 16.38 percent in the other States (an increase such that total national production equals projections with no climate change.) Such pronounced geographic shifts are unlikely given the relatively small heat stress effects we estimate. However, the size of the shifts falls within the range of the predicted production changes between 2010 and 2030.\nCompared to the 2030 baseline, the shift in production to regions less affected by climate change mitigates the total effect of climate change. However, the mitigation is very small-total milk production falls by 0.83 percent compared to 0.86 percent. The mitigation effect is small mainly because the predicted increases in the THI load in Groups 1, 2, and 3 are relatively similar, so the benefits from shifting production are limited. Dairies in Group 4 are predicted to experience a much larger average increase in THI load than the other regions, but Group 4 produced only 9.7 percent of national milk output in 2010.\nScenario 2 (table 7) illustrates how an increase in production in one region could offset the effect of climate change. Shifts in production from one State to another cannot completely offset the effects of climate change since all States are negatively affected by climate change. However, if production expanded in some States because of market or policy changes, this could partially offset the negative effects of climate change. For example, consider an increase in milk production in Group 1 of 3.3 percent compared to the 2030 predicted baseline (which increases national output by 0.88 percent). This is sufficient to offset the negative climate effect (-0.86 percent) . This is a relatively minor change, especially compared to the predicted increase in output (62.1 percent) between 2010 and 2030 that would have occurred without any climate change."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Qualifications", "text": "The empirical approach used in this study extrapolates from how dairy productivity currently responds to variation in the THI load to predict future responses to climate change. As with many forecasts, this approach assumes that the currently available technologies (and other factors) do not change over time. Of course, technologies are likely to evolve over the next 20 years, which will increase overall productive efficiency and producers' ability to respond to heat stress. It is likely that heat abatement technologies will improve, more heat-resistant breeds will be developed and adopted, and production will shift to regions with cooler climates. Hence, our estimates likely represent an upper bound on the production effects from increased heat stress due to climate change. We used past trends in dairy location and production to improve our predictions of climate change impacts, and we simulated the effect of a potential response to climate in terms of regional shifts in production. However, it is difficult to accurately forecast producer responses to climate change-in terms of the operation's location, size, vintage, specialization, or technological change.\nA second caveat is that we did not account for how climate might affect milk quality. In addition to reducing the quantity of milk produced, some studies have found that heat stress can lower the protein percentage and fat content of milk (Ingraham et al., 1979; Knapp and Grummer, 1991; Moore et al., 1992; Kadzere et al., 2002) . To the extent that these qualities are positively correlated with milk price, our estimates would tend to underestimate the costs to producers and consumers of heat stress and, consequently, of climate change. 16\n16 Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the price received by the producer to adjust for milk quality. This would be possible if the milk price reflected only milk quality. However, the milk price may also reflect the costs of production. If regional prices reflect local production costs, and heat stress raises production costs, then heat stress will result in higher prices. Hence, heat stress will lower milk quality, which lowers prices, but also raise production costs and milk prices. It is not possible to distinguish between these effects with the data at hand."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "Climate Change, Heat Stress, and U.S. Dairy Production, Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Based on an analysis of U.S. dairies located in a wide variety of climates, we find a negative relationship between average heat stress (THI load) and technical efficiency. Estimates of the stochastic production function model indicate that an increase in THI load of 1,000 degree hours implies about a 0.38-percent decrease in milk production. We use this result and forecasts from four climate models to estimate the amount of production that will be lost from the additional heat stress caused by global warming, holding all else equal. We estimate that in 2030, with no market response, the additional heat stress will lower milk production for the average dairy by 0.60 to 1.35 percent, depending on the climate model. In some States, mostly in the South, the average dairy will experience production declines greater than 2 percent. Allowing for higher market prices resulting from the contraction in production, we estimate total annual welfare costs of climate change-induced heat stress of $106 to $269 million. Because we assume that operators do not respond to environmental changes-e.g., by adopting new technologies or breeds, or by changing location-these estimates are upper bounds on likely output effects and costs. The estimates do not take into account the effect of the 2014 Farm Act or other policy changes.\nValued at 2010 prices, we estimate that heat stress currently reduces milk production by $1.20 billion per year compared to a hypothetical climate scenario with no heat stress. Despite these substantial costs, U.S. dairies operate in diverse climates, including very warm regions in the South. This suggests that other factors (e.g., input prices, output prices, distance to markets, policies, etc.) in addition to climate are important in determining the location of production. While heat stress appears to be an important determinant of technical efficiency, it is just one of many factors influencing productivity and profitability.\nWhile the scale of the estimated production effects from climate change in 2030 is modest, over a longer time horizon climate change is likely to be much more extreme and could result in substantially higher THI loads and efficiency losses. It is worth emphasizing that this study did not consider other potential costs of climate change for the livestock sector. Climate change will likely alter the price and availability of feed crops, the location and productivity of pasture and rangeland, and the distribution of livestock parasites and pathogens. Estimating the magnitude of these potential effects is an important area for future research.\nBecause climate change occurs gradually, it should be possible to mitigate some of the negative consequences for livestock production through research into and development of adaptive technologies and practices. Possible innovations to address climate change-induced heat stress include more energy-efficient cooling for animal housing, improved heat tolerant breeds, and improvements in scientific knowledge about the interactions between feed, nutrition, and heat stress. USDA supports agricultural research on climate change adaptation and recently formed seven Regional Hubs for Risk Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change. The Climate Hubs have the goal to help farmers cope with the consequences of climate change and represent a partnership with public and land-grant universities, Cooperative Extension, USDA researchers, the private sector, and State/local/regional governments. Malcolm et al. (2012) use the Jones et al. (2009) downscaled data to compute the average monthly values for maximum and minimum temperatures on agricultural land within 48 Regional Environment and Agriculture Programming (REAP) regions. To use these data, we first scale these estimates to the county level using a REAP-to-county crosswalk. Some counties are in more than one REAP region; when this is the case, we use the portion of the county that is in the REAP region to weight predictions. Refer to these predictions as PMin cm and PMax cm , where c refers to county and m to month. These are the predicted changes between 2000 and 2030 in temperature minimum and maximum by county and month.\nTo estimate the long-term THI load in 2030, we make use of the grid-cell-level daily dew point and temperature minima and maxima for 1990 -2005 (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009 "}]
