Various forms of therapy have failed to show clinical benefit in individuals with AD. 2 In the absence of disease-modifying pharmacotherapy for AD, identifying and potentially targeting early pathologic processes that may lead to the development of AD are essential in developing prevention strategies.\nOxidative stress, defined as excessive production of free radicals relative to total tissue antioxidant reserves, has emerged from in vitro and preclinical studies as a key pathologic process in the development of AD. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In transgenic mouse models, depletion of the reduced form of the tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH)-the most abundant intracellular antioxidant and free radical scavenger and a reliable marker of oxidative stress 9 -has been reported to precede amyloid oligomerization and plaque formation, 10,11 both pathologic hallmarks of AD. A self-propagating cycle of free radical formation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque formation has also been shown in vitro. 12 Furthermore, it has been suggested that amyloid may have antioxidant properties, thereby serving as a compensatory mechanism in the presence of oxidative stress. 13 However, the relationship between oxidative stress and amyloidosis in humans remains poorly understood, particularly early in the disease course when oxidative stress may serve as a potential target for disease-modifying interventions.\nThe primary aim of this study was therefore to assess the relationship between proton MR spectroscopy measures of GSH levels and brain amyloidosis, as assessed by positron-emission tomography with the amyloid tracer Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), 14 in a prospective cognitively healthy community cohort of elderly subjects.

The MR imaging protocol consisted of a structural T1-weighted spoiled gradient-recalled echo volumetric scan for tissue segmentation and an axial fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scan to exclude focal pathology.\nIn vivo 1 H-MR spectroscopy data were obtained from a 2.5 \u03eb 2.5 \u03eb 2.5 cm 3 voxel prescribed in the medial parietal lobe to include the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus-a region chosen because multiple prior studies reported early involvement of these regions by AD due to their inclusion in the memory network. [23] [24] [25] [26] The standard J-edited spin-echo difference method with TE/TR \u03ed 68/1500 ms was used to measure the levels of reduced GSH, as previously described [27] [28] [29] [30] and illustrated in Fig 1.

Subtracting these 2 subspectra yielded a 1 H-MR spectrum consisting of only the edited GSH \u2424-cysteinyl resonance at 2.98 ppm. A high test-retest reliability has been reported for detection of \u2425-aminobutyric acid with this MR spectroscopy technique on the same 3T GE Healthcare Excite HD instrument. 33 Spectral data for this study were acquired in 15 minutes by using 290 interleaved excitations (580 total) with the editing pulses on or off. The area under the GSH resonance, which is proportional to the concentration of GSH in the voxel of interest, was obtained by frequency-domain spectral fitting as previously described. 28 The derived GSH peak areas were then expressed semiquantitatively as ratios relative to the unsuppressed intravoxel water signal for normalization across subjects before being used in group analyses. To estimate the proportions of gray matter, white matter, and CSF contained in the voxel of interest, the volumetric spoiled gradient-recalled echo MR imaging data were segmented by using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8)."}, {"section_title": "Pittsburgh Compound-B PET Image Acquisition and Analysis", "text": "All subjects underwent an amyloid PET scanning on a Biograph PET-CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; 1-mm full width at half maximum, 25-cm FOV) by using a standardized research protocol. 17 All subjects received an intravenous catheter for injection of 15 mCi of PiB. Sixty minutes after injection, subjects were scanned for 30 minutes with their eyes open in a quiet, dimly lit room. A low-dose CT scan was acquired for attenuation correction, and all images were reconstructed into a 512 \u03eb 512 matrix.\nSummed PET images corresponding to the 60 -90 minutes of PiB data were generated and nonlinearly normalized to a PiB template. The PiB template was generated by averaging the summed images of 48 cognitively healthy individuals in the same age range, which were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) on-line data repository (adni.loni. usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD, with the primary goal of testing whether serial MR imaging, positron-emission tomography, other biologic markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment may be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer disease. More information may be obtained at www. adni-info.org.\nOrientation and origin for all the PiB PET images were automatically fixed to the anterior commissure to match the templates used in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK), because the \"normal-ize\" function of SPM uses the origin as a starting estimate. These reoriented PiB PET images and the mean PiB template were skullstripped with the FSL Brain Extraction Tool (http://fsl.fmrib.ox. ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET) 34 to avoid any bias induced by skull staining. All the skull-stripped PiB PET images were then nonlinearly warped to the skull-stripped mean PiB template. Gray matter regions were parcellated by using the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas of SPM to obtain 116 automated ROIs. 35 Regional PiB uptake values were then normalized by the subject's cerebellar reference uptake.\nPrior ADNI publications determined that the 4 large regions of the brain that are most useful in measuring the degree of brain amyloidosis are the frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal regions, with the cerebellum as a reference region. [36] [37] [38] [39] Using ROIs from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas, we determined amyloid deposition in the frontal region by averaging the uptake values from the bilateral superior frontal, bilateral superior orbital frontal, bilateral middle frontal, bilateral inferior frontal opercular, bilateral inferior frontal triangularis, bilateral supplemental motor, bilateral medial superior frontal, and bilateral middle orbital frontal regions of the brain. The cingulate region included the bilateral anterior, middle, and posterior cingulum regions. The lateral parietal region included the bilateral superior and inferior parietal regions, as well as the precuneus.

We also examined the distribution of brain tissue proportions within our subject cohort to identify outliers.\nTo assess whether there was an association between GSH and brain amyloidosis, based on uptake on PiB PET, we used ordinary least-squares regression analysis with amyloid levels in each of the 4 brain regions as the outcome variable and GSH as the predictor variable. Because APOE 4 carrier status has been shown to be associated with increased brain amyloidosis in the literature, [40] [41] [42] [43] carrier status was included as a covariate to adjust for this confounding factor.\nThe robustness of any association between GSH and amyloidosis was examined by bootstrapping the original cohort of subjects 1000 times to obtain 95% confidence intervals. 44 The effect of a clear outlier (high parietal amyloidosis and low GSH) on the association was examined by performing the analyses both with and without this data point. To assess the effect sizes of our associations, we estimated the correlation coefficients between GSH and amyloidosis, with \u03fd0.1 indicating a small effect, 0.1-0.5 indicating a medium effect, and \u03fe0.5 indicating a large effect. 45 We also calculated the partial eta-squared for GSH on the basis of the regression models, 46 with \u03fd0.06 indicating a small effect, 0.06 -0.14 indicating a medium effect, and \u03fe0.14 indicating a large effect. 47 To assess whether there was an association between GSH levels and memory, we again used ordinary least-squares regression analysis with GSH as the predictor and the age-adjusted subscores from the RBANS as the outcome variable. Because APOE 4 carrier status is known to be a risk factor for AD, 48, 49 it was again included as a covariate.\nFinally, we explored the associations between GSH and potential mediators of oxidative stress, including obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and exercise, again by using ordinary least-squares regression analyses."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Subjects ranged in age from 55 to 72 years (mean, 63 \u03ee 5 years), and 5 (33%) of the subjects were women.

The major finding was that GSH levels, measured with 1 H-MR spectroscopy, are negatively associated with brain amyloidosis, as assessed with PiB PET, in the temporal and parietal regions. In this cognitively healthy cohort, there were no associations between GSH levels and immediate and delayed memory.\nThe inverse association between levels of GSH and temporal and parietal amyloid levels supports a role for oxidative stress in amyloid plaque formation-a finding that is consistent with prior laboratory and preclinical studies. 5, [6] [7] [8] [46] [47] [48] [49] An association between oxidative stress and amyloidosis has also been suggested by clinical studies on AD. Mandal et al 50 found that GSH levels measured by 1 H-MR spectroscopy could accurately discriminate among healthy subjects, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with AD, with decreased GSH levels being associated with increased levels of cognitive impairment. In postmortem AD brains, 51 depleted GSH levels accompanied the diagnosis of AD. There have also been reports associating GSH depletion with mitochondrial dysfunction 52, 53 and neuronal degeneration. 54, 55 On the other hand, increased GSH levels have been reported in those with mild cognitive impairment compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that there may be a compensatory up-regulation of GSH in the early stages of AD. 56 However, no direct relationship between oxidative stress and amyloidosis was established in any of the prior clinical studies because subject groups were defined clinically without quantifying the degree of underlying amyloidosis. In the present study, with an advanced 1 H-MR spectroscopy editing technique that enables reliable in vivo measurements of GSH, we have obtained strong preliminary evidence of an inverse relationship between GSH levels and amyloidosis in older adults, even before the onset of mild cognitive impairment. Replication in larger cohorts would both solidify this result and support measurement of brain GSH levels with 1 H-MR spectroscopy as a noninvasive biomarker of AD risk early in disease development.\nThis study also investigated whether GSH levels are associated with memory because memory deficits are known to be the earliest clinical manifestation of AD 57 and predict time-to-progression from cognitively healthy to mild cognitive impairment. 58 Because oxidative stress can exert deleterious effects on mitochondrial function and neuronal integrity, we surmised that GSH depletion could also lead to memory dysfunction. Two prior studies that included subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD reported conflicting results, with one reporting GSH deficits in mild cognitive impairment and AD 50 and the other reporting a potential compensatory increase of GSH in mild cognitive impairment. 56 Our study found no associations between GSH levels and cognitive scores in our cognitively healthy cohort, necessitating further studies in larger cohorts.\nIn exploring associations between GSH and AD risk factors, we found a trend-level inverse association between GSH levels and body mass index. Barnes and Yaffe 15 previously reported that up to 54% of AD cases may be attributable to modifiable risk factors, with 21% attributable to physical inactivity and 7% attributable to obesity. In the present cohort, we explored the association between these risk factors and GSH levels and found a trendlevel negative association with body mass index, which could be consistent with a prior large cohort study of \u03fe2000 subjects, which found increased markers of oxidative stress, which would deplete GSH, with increased body mass index. 59 If this finding is validated, monitoring GSH levels by 1 H-MR spectroscopy could also serve as a biomarker of the potential benefits of various lifestyle-modification regimens, without the radiation risk and cost of PET imaging.\nFinally, this study has a number of limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, potentially limiting both statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Replication of these findings in larger cohorts will be necessary. Second, our cohort consisted of cognitively healthy individuals. As a result, subjects did not have significant memory deficits, possibly limiting our ability to detect statistically significant associations between GSH and memory, particularly in a small cohort. Third, we targeted the precuneus for GSH measurement with MR spectroscopy because this region is affected early in AD pathology. However, there may be abnormalities in other brain regions, which would need to be investigated to obtain a more complete understanding of oxidative stress-associated brain damage in AD and its prodromal stages. Furthermore, although we found associations between GSH and amyloidosis, longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether decreased GSH levels increase subsequent risk of developing AD. Finally, we did not enroll a control group for comparison with our cognitively healthy cohort. As a result, it is not known whether the GSH levels detected in our cohort are significantly abnormal."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This is the first study, to our knowledge, to explore in vivo associations between GSH and brain amyloidosis, as well as GSH and memory in a cognitively healthy cohort.
