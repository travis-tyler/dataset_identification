[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "OBJECTIVE: Obesity is prevalent among women of reproductive age, and developmental disabilities in children continue to increase. We examined associations between mother's prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and physical and developmental disabilities, and objective measures of reading and math skills and fine and gross motor function in children. METHODS: We used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B; n \u00bc 5200), a cohort of children born in 2001 and followed until kindergarten. Children were classified according to maternal prepregnancy BMI (in kg per m 2 ): underweight (BMI o18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese class I (BMI 30.0-34.9) and obese class II/III (BMI X35.0). Parent reports of doctor-diagnosed disabilities were collected up to kindergarten and classified as learning and behavioral or physical. Children's reading and math and fine and gross motor function were assessed at kindergarten according to standardized tests. Linear and modified logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal sociodemographic variables, family enrichment variables, and children's sex, age and year of kindergarten entry. Additional adjustment for current child BMI was performed in separate models. All data are weighted to be nationally representative of the children born in 2001. RESULTS: Compared with children of normal-weight mothers, children born to obese class II/III mothers had an increased risk of learning or behavioral (risk ratio 1.67; 95% confidence interval 1.27, 2.21)), but not physical disabilities (risk ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.27, 1.22). Gross (Po0.001), but not fine (P \u00bc 0.06) motor function was significantly associated with maternal BMI, but gross motor function was attenuated after adjustment for current child BMI (P \u00bc 0.05). Children's reading scores (P \u00bc 0.01) but not math scores (P \u00bc 0.11) were significantly associated with maternal BMI. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative US cohort, children born to severely obese mothers had an increased risk for diagnosed learning and behavioral but not physical disabilities by kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Obesity is associated with metabolic changes including systemic chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress and hyperglycemia. 1 In 2009, B1 in 5 pregnant women were obese when they became pregnant. 2 Metabolic changes, such as increased insulin resistance in the second and third trimesters, are part of a healthy pregnancy; 3 however, when augmented with the metabolic state associated with prepregnancy obesity, these changes may be exacerbated, such that the metabolic and immune state of the mother may have profound effects on the developing fetus. 4, 5 For example, it is well observed that maternal obesity is associated with neural tube defects. 6 Similarly, increased oxidative stress associated with obesity may negatively impact the developing fetal brain, leading to later disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders. 7 Because there are complex interactions between the maternal immune system and the fetal developing central nervous system, alterations in the balance of the intrauterine immune system may cause neurodevelopmental damage, leading to the pathogenesis of cognitive disabilities and adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. [8] [9] [10] [11] Given these potential biological mechanisms, there is increasing interest in epidemiologic research related to maternal prepregnancy weight and child developmental outcomes. 12 To date, most research is from European cohorts, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] where the prevalence of prepregnancy obesity is lower than in the United States, or from smaller 18, 19 or less generalizable US cohorts limited to a single state. 20, 21 Although most, but not all, 13 have observed an adverse effect of maternal obesity, it remains unclear if modest differences observed using cognitive assessment batteries 17, 19, 22 translate to clinically relevant outcomes in children.\nUsing a nationally representative US cohort, we previously reported an increased risk for delayed mental development at age 2 years, assessed using a validated standardized assessment, among children born to mothers who were underweight or severely obese before pregnancy. 23 To extend this prior research, we investigated the association between maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and children's development at kindergarten. In the present analysis, children's developmental outcomes included diagnosed physical and developmental disabilities, as well as reading and math skills, and fine and gross motor function that were objectively measured using standardized assessments. 1 "}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "We utilized data from the US Department of Education's Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative cohort of children born in 2001 who were followed until kindergarten entry. In order to protect participant identity, per our data agreement, all sample sizes reported in the paper are rounded to the nearest 50 and percentages are reported as weighted population estimates. This analysis was reviewed by a human subjects coordinator at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and determined to be research not involving human subjects.\nThe ECLS-B participants were selected using birth certificates from the Vital Statistics System of the National Center for Health Statistics and included an oversample of twins, select racial-ethnic groups and infants born weighing o2500 g. Participant data were collected across five waves. At wave one, 10 700 participants, B9 months of age, were enrolled. Waves two and three occurred at approximately ages 2 and 4 years, respectively. Mostly because of birthdate cut-points for kindergarten enrollment, not all children in the ECLS-B started kindergarten in the same school year. "}, {"section_title": "Maternal prepregnancy BMI", "text": "At wave one, biological mothers of participants were asked their height and prepregnancy weight. Prepregnancy BMI (in kg per m 2 ) was calculated and categorized as: underweight (BMI o18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese class I (BMI 30.0-34.9) and obese classes II and III (BMI X35.0)."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "Children's Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II At wave two, children's mental and motor development was assessed using a shortened validated version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II). 25 ECLS-B provided age-standardized T-scores (mean 50, s.d. 10), normalized to the ECLS-B population.\nChildren's disability diagnoses At select waves, the parent respondent or primary caregiver reported if their child had been previously diagnosed by a doctor with select disabilities (Supplementary Table 1 ). We classified children as having a learning or behavioral disability if they were ever diagnosed with autism or pervasive development disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, stuttering, intellectual disability or another developmental delay. Because stuttering can be considered a communication disorder, we also examined learning and behavioral disabilities independent of stuttering. Children were classified as having a physical disability if they were ever diagnosed with hearing loss, blindness, epilepsy or a motor disability such as cerebral palsy. We also examined the physical disability composite excluding children with epilepsy. Because of the limited sample size and the rarity of many of the conditions, we were restricted from analyzing the individual disabilities separately.\nChildren's reading and mathematics skills Children's early reading and math skills were assessed at kindergarten by certified fieldworkers according to standardized tests based on components of instruments used in other large-scale studies. 26 Using these tests, ECLS-B generated scales scores for reading and math skills. 26 We generated standardized reading and math Z-scores from the scale scores developed by ECLS-B.\nChildren's fine and gross motor function At kindergarten, children's fine and gross motor skills were assessed using components of standard instruments administered by certified fieldworkers. 26 To assess fine motor function, children were asked to build a gate using blocks and to copy four geometric shapes. Each drawing was scored as pass/fail by certified coders. We classified children who did not successfully build the gate and pass at least half of the shape assessments with low fine motor function. Gross motor skills were assessed using various physical tasks including jumping horizontally, balancing, hopping, skipping, walking backwards and catching. The distance jumped was compared with all children in the cohort and if the distance was less than the 10th percentile we classified children as failing the jumping assessment. Fieldworkers classified all other tasks as pass/fail. Children who did not complete a task because of a physical limitation (no50) were classified as having failed the assessment. We summed the number of gross motor tasks failed and classified children who failed more than half with low gross motor function."}, {"section_title": "Additional variables", "text": "Mother's age at delivery, race-ethnicity, parity, marital status, schooling and smoking history during pregnancy as well as children's sex were obtained from the child's birth certificates. At wave three, the number of children's books in the house (p20, 21-99, X100), whether the parents read to the child everyday (yes/no) and the total hours of television viewed by the child in a typical weekday (42 h, yes/no) were assessed and used as indicators of learning enrichment. Family poverty status at kindergarten was determined by household income and size and classified according to the federal poverty limit (o130, 130 to o185 and X185%). 27 At kindergarten, children's height and weight were measured at least twice according to a standard protocol. Children were classified according to sex and age-specific BMI percentiles as underweight (o5), normal weight (5 to o85), overweight (85 to o95) or obese (X95). 28 Analysis and study sample\nWe limited our analysis to singletons born without major congenital anomalies. Of the 8850 eligible participants, 2150 were lost to follow-up by kindergarten entry and a random sample of 1150 participants was not included at kindergarten because of budgetary restraints, leaving 5550 participants. We performed a complete-subject analysis and excluded participants lacking exposure or covariate data (n \u00bc 300), resulting in 5200 children with disability data, weighted to be representative of B3.5 million singleton US children born in 2001.\nIn a previous ECLS-B analysis, we examined mental and motor development at age 2 years by prepregnancy BMI. 23 To assess the effect of attrition from our previous study to the present sample, we compared the characteristics of the available sample to those excluded. Many demographics of the current sample differed from those excluded; however, no differences were observed in prepregnancy BMI (Supplementary Table 2 ). To further verify that attrition and missing data did not bias the current sample, we reexamined the association between neurodevelopment at age 2 years and prepregnancy BMI using the present sample available at kindergarten and found similar effect sizes as in our previous analysis 23 (data not shown). For the current study, a subset of children did not complete reading and math assessments at kindergarten and thus were excluded from the reading and math analyses (n \u00bc 150). Compared with the remaining sample (n \u00bc 5100), those excluded differed with regard to maternal race-ethnicity (P \u00bc 0.02), had lower poverty status (P \u00bc 0.02) and were more likely to have a learning or behavioral (39.5% vs 12.4%; Po0.001) or physical disability (10.0% vs 4.6%; P \u00bc 0.01) (data not shown). Similarly, a subset of children did not complete the motor assessments (n \u00bc 450) and were excluded from the motor analyses. Compared with the remaining sample (n \u00bc 4750), those excluded had mothers with less schooling (P \u00bc 0.02), lower poverty status (Po0.001) and were more likely to have a learning or behavioral (27.3% vs 11.8%; Po0.001) or physical disability (8.6% vs 4.4%; P \u00bc 0.003) (data not shown).\nAs a means of verifying maternal report of disability diagnoses, we examined all objectively measured indicators of children's development (mental and motor BSID-II T-scores at age 2 years, reading and math Z-scores at kindergarten and motor function at kindergarten) by disability diagnoses.\nWe examined the independent associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and children's disability diagnoses and objective measures of development. We used linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic models modified to calculate model-adjusted risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. 29 We used a directed acyclic graph to inform decisions as to which variables to include in the models (Figure 1 ). 30 We made the assumption that an unobserved latent 'lifestyle' variable influenced both mother's prepregnancy BMI and children's development (through family enrichment). Based on the latter assumption, the minimally sufficient set of variables required to assess the total effect of prepregnancy BMI on development was determined to be demographics, smoking and enrichment. 31 Because the directionality of the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and enrichment is truly unknown, and contrary to our assumptions, enrichment could be influenced by prepregnancy BMI, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we did not adjust for enrichment, as in this case enrichment would be on the causal pathway. No models included mediators of the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and development, that is, gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes or hypertension and fetal growth (shown in Figure 1 with dashed lines). 32 Furthermore, although potentially also on the causal pathway, we performed a sensitivity analysis adjusted for children's weight status at kindergarten entry, as these relationships are complex and children of obese mothers are more likely to be obese and obesity in children has been shown to correlate with children's developmental status. All models were adjusted for children's age at kindergarten entry. No evidence of multicollinearity between variables was detected for any model. Approximately 4% of mothers were o18 years old and because the use of adult BMI-classification cut-points may have misclassified adolescents mothers, 33 we performed sensitivity analyses limited to children of mothers aged X18 years.\nWe used Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.2 (Cary, NC, USA) with SAS-Callable SUDAAN version 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The P-values of o0.05 were considered to be indicative of significant differences. All analyses were weighted using ECLS-B survey weights to account for subject lost to follow-up and the complex sample survey design. Taylor Series approximations were used to estimate standard errors."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "By kindergarten entry, 16.0% of children had been diagnosed with a disability. Specifically, 13.0% of children had a learning or behavioral disability, of which 25.0% had more than one learning or behavioral disability. Overall, 4.7% of children had a physical disability, of which 8.3% had more than one physical disability. As a means to verify maternal report of children's disabilities, we evaluated the objective measures of development that were collected independent of the maternal report (that is, Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II, reading and math scores and motor function) by children's disability status. Compared with those with no disabilities, children with any disability had significantly lower mental and motor development T-scores, lower reading and math Z-scores and a higher prevalence of low fine and gross motor function (Po0.001 for all comparisons; Table 1 ).\nBefore pregnancy, 5.3% of mothers were underweight, 54.9% were normal weight, 25.0% were overweight, 8.6% were class I obese and 6.2% were class II or III obese. All maternal characteristics examined varied by prepregnancy BMI (Table 2) . Underweight mothers tended to be younger, less likely to be married, have less schooling, have smoked during their pregnancy and live in poverty compared with normal-weight mothers. Obese class II or III mothers also were less likely to be married, have at least 16 years of schooling compared with normal-weight mothers and the greatest proportion of obese class II or III mothers lived below 130% of the federal poverty limit. Learning enrichmentrelated variables also tended to correlate with maternal prepregnancy BMI status, such that children of normal-weight mothers were the most likely to be read to daily and watch o2 h of TV on weekdays. Children's weight status at kindergarten was strongly associated with their mother's prepregnancy BMI status. Although 76.3% of children of underweight mothers were considered normal weight at kindergarten, only 46.1% of children born to class II or III obese mothers fell into this category. Class II or III obese mothers had the greatest proportion of obese children (37.6%).\nIn models adjusted for maternal demographics, smoking and enrichment, prepregnancy BMI was significantly associated with learning or behavioral disabilities in children with the greatest risk among children of class II and III obese mothers (Table 3) . This association remained when stuttering was excluded from the composite and when adjusted for current child weight status. A greater proportion of children of underweight mothers had a physical disability compared with children of normal-weight mothers and this association was strengthened when epilepsy was excluded from the composite, although overall the global association was not significant (P \u00bc 0.32). When also adjusted for current child weight status, there was suggestion of an increased risk of physical disabilities associated with maternal class II and III obesity; however, this was attenuated when epilepsy was removed from the composite, and the overall association was nonsignificant (P \u00bc 0.11). Comparatively, children of class II and III obese mothers had an increased risk for low fine and gross motor development, but when adjusted for current child weight status, the associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and children's motor development, particularly gross motor, were attenuated (Table 4 ). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy BMI and children's reading scores, but not math scores (Table 5 ). All associations were similar in sensitivity analyses in which enrichment variables were not included or when limited to children born to nonadolescent mothers (data not shown). mothers who were normal weight. In addition, children's reading scores were significantly associated with maternal pregnancy BMI. We did not, however, observe a significant association between prepregnancy BMI and diagnosis of physical disabilities in children and the associations with motor function were attenuated after including current child BMI in the model. These findings are consistent with our previous study 23 in which we observed an increased risk for delayed mental function, but not motor function, at 2 years of age in children born to severely obese mothers, and demonstrate that the association persists to kindergarten age and coincides with an increased risk of clinical outcomes of learning and behavioral disabilities."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Similar to other national estimates, 34 13% of children in our study had a learning or behavioral disability diagnosis, potentially including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism or pervasive development disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, intellectual disability, stuttering or another developmental delay. Among children whose mothers were severely obese at the start of their pregnancy, the prevalence of learning or behavioral disabilities at kindergarten was 20.4%, in comparison with only 11.9% of children born to normal-weight mothers, leading to a 67% increased risk of diagnosis. This association was maintained after removing stuttering from the composite, as stuttering is also considered a communication disorder. Because of the rarity of these conditions and sample size, we were precluded from estimating associations with individual conditions; therefore, future investigations disentangling the risks by specific conditions may be important. Nonetheless, research suggests that considerable overlap exists between these conditions and they do not typically occur in isolation. 35 Our study supports this notion, as approximately a quarter of children with learning or behavioral disability had more than one of the selected conditions.\nOur finding that maternal obesity may be a risk factor for learning and behavioral disabilities in children is consistent with previous literature. With the exception of a study that combined overweight and obesity and observed inconsistent findings, 13 all other studies have reported an adverse association between prepregnancy obesity and lower child cognitive scores, 17, 19, 22, 23 intellectual disability, 14, 21 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms 15, 16, 18 and autism in children. 20 Our study builds on this literature by utilizing a population-based US cohort, examining both disabilities and objective measures of development, and severe obesity separately from class I obesity. Notably, we found the strongest risk among children born to severely obese mothers. In contrast to our previous study of children at age 2 years, 23 we did not observe an increased risk of learning or behavioral disabilities among children born to underweight mothers. It is plausible that any deleterious effect of prepregnancy underweight dissipated by kindergarten, as mental development scores at age 2 years in children born to underweight mothers were not as low as in children of severely obese mothers.\nApproximately 15% of mothers in our sample were obese at the start of their pregnancy, of whom almost half were severely obese. Severely obese mothers are known to have the greatest risk for maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, and we observed that their children also have an increased risk for learning or behavioral disabilities. 36 It is hypothesized that the inflammatory intrauterine environment associated with maternal obesity interrupts the fetal central nervous system development and makes it more susceptible to other environmental insults by disrupting the blood brain barrier, all potentially leading to the increased risk for disabilities. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Our findings are independent of sociodemographic factors and select learning and enrichment variables. Factors such as maternal chronic diseases or weight gain or loss during pregnancy may act downstream of prepregnancy obesity, further affecting the intrauterine environment and leading to neurodevelopmental damage and the pathogenesis of cognitive disabilities and adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. [8] [9] [10] Alternatively, specific characteristics of maternal diet associated with obesity may also be important. 37 Furthermore, these conditions, in addition to obesity, may also adversely affect fetal growth or the length of gestation, 33 and thus potentially affect neurodevelopment. 38 In this analysis we did not adjust for these mediating factors, 32 and thus future studies focused on clarifying the underlying mechanism will be important to fully understand the implications of our findings and the potential relevant time frame for interventions. Some studies have included pregnancy weight gain in models related to prepregnancy BMI and observed no association. 21 Others have specifically examined Children who did not successfully pass the gate building assessment and at least half of the copy shape assessments were classified as having low fine motor function. Children who passed less than half of the gross motor tasks were classified as having low gross motor function. Learning or behavioral disability classified as ever diagnosed with ADHD, autism or PDD, ODD, intellectual disability, stuttering or other developmental delay.\ne Physical disability classified as ever diagnosed with hearing loss, blindness, epilepsy or mobility disability such as cerebral palsy.\nweight gain as the exposure. One study of predominantly nonobese mothers observed no association when accounting for familial factors. 39 Another study observed that weight gain both below and above recommendations was associated with lower academic achievement at 16 years of age, and although they found that the association may differ according to the timing of weight gain, they did not examine the associations in obese mothers separately from overweight mothers. 40 The mechanism by which maternal BMI is associated with child development may alternatively be driven through an increased risk for obesity in the children. For example, the observed association may be due, in part, to poor motor development in obese children, residual confounding due to external factors that could potentially cause obesity and developmental delays, or poor motor function may precede child obesity. 41 We adjusted for children's weight status at kindergarten entry in a separate model, as the relationship is likely complex and it is unclear whether it is a confounder or mediator of the association, and this may vary according to specific conditions within the composites. The estimates related to learning or behavioral disabilities were unaffected by the additional adjustment, but we observed a slightly stronger association with physical disabilities such that maternal underweight was associated with an increased risk, and class II and III obesity was associated with a reduced risk, but the overall association with maternal BMI remained nonsignificant. When epilepsy was removed from the composite, the association with class II and III obesity was attenuated, suggesting that some of the association may have been because of a reduced risk for epilepsy, and this should be explored further using more detailed data on epilepsy. Comparatively, although the overall association with gross motor development was attenuated when adjusted for current child weight status, severe obesity was still associated with an increased risk of low gross motor function compared with children of normal-weight mothers, highlighting that these children may have a particularly higher risk than their peers.\nOur study has important strengths and limitations. Although we used a large population-based cohort, generalizable to US children born in 2001, as with most longitudinal cohorts, there was attrition in the sample that could potentially lead to bias in our results; however, much of the loss of sample was because of a random sample of children who were not followed-up to kindergarten because of budgetary restraints. To help inform if this loss to follow-up biased our results, we reconfirmed our prior findings 23 at age 2 years specifically among the sample who had data at kindergarten. Prepregnancy BMI was calculated from self-reported height and prepregnancy weight, which may result in an underestimate of BMI among heavier mothers and an overestimate among lighter mothers; 42 however, a previous study found that some short-term obstetric outcomes were robust to misclassification in prepregnancy BMI status. 42 Furthermore, any reporting bias in prepregnancy weight and height is independent of our outcomes, which occurred much later. Although some of children's developmental outcomes were based on standardized Models adjusted for child's sex, age at final assessment, year of kindergarten entry, TV hours, number of children's books in the house and typical number of nights parent reads to the child, as well as maternal age, race-ethnicity, parity, schooling, poverty and smoking during pregnancy. c Learning or behavioral disability classified as ever diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism or pervasive development disorder (PDD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), intellectual disability, stuttering or other developmental delay.\nd Physical disability classified as ever diagnosed with hearing loss, blindness, epilepsy or mobility disability such as cerebral palsy.\ne Models adjusted for all variables above and child weight status at kindergarten entry.
