[{"section_title": "", "text": "sequence identity) (Supplementary Figure 1) . 21, 29 Next, we sought to investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by performing ancestral sequence reconstruction for the Spike-RBD amino acid sequence ( Figure 1A) . While cross-species protein sequence comparisons have been used to investigate critical amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, 37 leveraging the phylogenetic relationships allows us to infer the most likely ancestral sequences for this protein allows us to focus on the subset of genetic changes that are specific to its recent evolution. 38 We inferred statistically well-supported reconstructions of the Spike-RBD sequence for both the common ancestor of all human SARS-CoV-2 cases (labelled \"N1\", Figure 1A ,C) and the its common ancestor with the closest animal virus (labelled \"N0\", Figure 1A ,C). N1 is identical to the Spike-RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, as expected, while the N0 Spike-RBD sequence is, to our knowledge, unique, reflecting the uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2's viral origin. 21 ,39 N0 differs from N1 at 4 positions (346, 372, 498, and 519 - Figure 1B) . The reconstruction of N1 for each of those positions is statistically well-supported, with a posterior probability (P.P.) of 1 obtained from two independent calculations (Supplemental Table 1 ; Supplementary Methods). The reconstruction for N0 has high statistical support for positions 346, 372, and 519 (P.P. > 0.94), while position 498 was ambiguously reconstructed, with two alternate states comparably probable (Supplemental Table 1 ). All other positions were reconstructed with high confidence (P.P.>0.85). Together, these four changes (t346R, t372A, h/y498Q, and n519H) differentiate the evolved SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein from the most recent common ancestor with animal viruses (Figure 1 ). As such, this ancestral virus must have existed at least as early as 2013 (as one of its descendants -RaTG13 -was isolated in that year), meaning that the branch between the N0 and N1 ancestors covers at least 7 years of molecular evolution ( Figure 1A) . To quantify functional differences between the N0 ancestor and the Spike-RBD sequences, we conducted 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations (see Supplementary Methods) of the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in complex with hACE2 (starting point for each simulation was modelled off crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD/hACE2 complex), 27 which we used to calculate the free energy contributions from electrostatics, polar solvation, van Der Waals interactions, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) to infer the free energy of binding between those two proteins. 40, 41 We quantified the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the portion of the RBD closest to the hACE2 receptor (residues 397 to 512) for each of our replicates to confirm complex stability (Supplementary Figure 2) . Contrary to our expectations, the free energy of binding between the Spike-RBD and the hACE2 appears to have decreased between N0 and N1. In fact, each of the 4 changes either reduced or did not significantly change the free energy of binding (Figure 2A ) (this is true for both alternate reconstructions of position 498 in N0). While overall these four historical changes reduced binding affinity to hACE2, they did not do so equally: t346R and h/y498Q showed the largest decreases in affinity ( Figure 2B) . Additionally, there was no evidence of an epistatic relationship among the four substitutions (see Supplementary Methods). Somewhat surprised by these reductions in binding energy between the N0 and N1 state, we set out to confirm that our observations were not an outcome of oversimplifications in the MD forcefield. We compared standardized changes in binding energy in our MD data and recently released in vitro data 42 and saw remarkably similar changes in binding energy (p = 0.042, Equivalence Test for Means) (Supplemental Table 3 ). In particular, both alternative reconstructed states for position 498 in N0 clearly improve hACE2 binding affinity in both our simulations and in in vitro functional measurements (Figure 2 ; Supplemental Table 3) . 42 There was a discrepancy between the two datasets at position 372 and future in vitro experiments are required to determine the combined effects of this mutation with the other substitutions (Figure 2 ; Supplemental Table  3) . Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, evolutionary changes since 2013 did not improve the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD's binding with hACE2. While there are other animal coronaviruses known to bind to the hACE2 receptor, 43 to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the SARS-CoV-2's common ancestor with the RaTG13 lineage may have been capable of binding to hACE2. This has important implications for our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evolved to infect humans. First, it suggests that the binding affinity between the Spike-RBD and hACE2 may not be a critical driver of the high degree of infectivity that has been observed during its recent outbreak. Instead, it suggests that tight hACE2 binding may be a latent property of this virus, and that high infectivity may instead have emerged via a distinct set of molecular changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Second, it calls into question the presumption of a recent zoonotic origin for this disease; while other molecular components of the current SARS-CoV-2 virus may have acquired recent evolutionary changes that promoted its infectivity in humans, it appears that the high affinity for hACE2 was not among them. If this is the case -that this viral lineage possessed the ability to bind hACE2 with high affinity for at least the past 7 years ( Figure 1B ) -then why did it not emerge as a public health issue until recently? One possibility is that binding hACE2 by the Spike-RBD is not sufficient, on its own, to infect humans, and that other molecular components first needed to acquire new functions to do so. A second possibility is that this virus may have been capable of infecting human cells for a longer period of time in the past, but that its ancestral form either presented with far fewer symptoms (making it less disruptive and/or noticeable to those infected), or that it was far less infectious (thereby impacting only a small number of people), in either case escaping the notice of public health monitoring (Figure 3 ). To test this, a broad and concerted effort to sequence the range of coronaviruses across human populations would need to be conducted, in order to test whether a closely related virus may also be circulating. [44] [45] [46] Naturally, as an in silico study, these results should be interpreted with some caution. Insofar as they can be validated, however, they are largely consistent with direct functional measurements in the lab. 42 Ideally, combinatorial libraries could be constructed 47,48 and functionally screened 48 in order to glean more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the recent evolution of this virus."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion:", "text": "Predicting the emergence of highly infectious and virulent diseases, while difficult, is vital for human population health. 50 To do so, however, we must take steps to understand how pandemic diseases -such as SARS-CoV-2 -emerged as they did, and to understand if and when they acquired the novel molecular functions that enabled their infectivity. In this case, it appears that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD did not recently evolve binding affinity to a human-specific protein.\nInstead, that function appears to have been latent, making it clear that the evolution of this disease -along with so many other aspects of its etiology -is more complex than expected."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods:", "text": "To confirm SARS-CoV-2 etiology we constructed a phylogenetic tree using PhyML 3.0 of 26 known enzootic and endemic viruses aligned using MAFFT version 7.

In Scenario 1, it is postulated that a zoonotic ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain possessed the ability to effectively bind hACE2 but was unable to effectively enter human cells, requiring the presence of subsequent mutations to infect humans.
