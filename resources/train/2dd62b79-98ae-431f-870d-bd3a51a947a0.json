[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Summary. Covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curves are often used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a biomarker with time-to-event outcomes, when certain covariates have an impact on the test accuracy. In many medical studies, measurements of biomarkers are subject to missingness due to high cost or limitation of technology. This article considers estimation of covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curves in the presence of missing biomarkers. To incorporate the covariate effect, we assume a proportional hazards model for the failure time given the biomarker and the covariates, and a semiparametric location model for the biomarker given the covariates. In the presence of missing biomarkers, we propose a simple weighted estimator for the ROC curves where the weights are inversely proportional to the selection probability. We also propose an augmented weighted estimator which utilizes information from the subjects with missing biomarkers. The augmented weighted estimator enjoys the double-robustness property in the sense that the estimator remains consistent if either the missing data process or the conditional distribution of the missing data given the observed data is correctly specified. We derive the large sample properties of the proposed estimators and evaluate their finite sample performance using numerical studies.

When covariates have an impact on the predictive accuracy of a biomarker, it is important to adjust for the covariate effects to ensure generalizability of the results to other different populations. Therefore, covariate-specific ROC curves are widely used for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers within specific subgroups (Liu and Zhou, 2011) .\nIn prospective cohort studies, information on biomarkers and disease status is often collected over time. Therefore, evaluation of biomarker accuracy with event time outcomes has attracted much interest, see Pepe, Zheng, and Jin (2008) for comprehensive reviews. With event time outcomes, subjects are classified as cases or controls depending on their survival status, and the biomarker accuracy can be evaluated at various time points of interest. Heagerty and Zheng (2005) discussed several definitions of time-dependent TPR and FPR, where instantaneous failures or cumulative failures are considered to define the cases, and dynamic survivors or a fixed group of survivors are considered to define the controls.\nIn this manuscript, we consider two types of covariatespecific time-dependent ROC curves: the Incident/Dynamic (I/D) ROC and the Cumulative/Dynamic (C/D) ROC (Heagerty and Zheng, 2005) . Let Z be a single marker or a combination of multiple markers, and X be a vector of covariates that affect the failure time T . Without loss of generality, we assume larger values of Z are associated with greater risks. The covariate-specific incident TPR, cumulative TPR and dynamic FPR at cutoff point c are defined respectively as TPR I (c; t, x) = P(Z > c|T = t, X = x), TPR C (c; t, x) = P(Z > c|T \u2264 t, X = x), where p \u2208 (0, 1). The I/D ROC curve is used to distinguish subjects failing at time t from those failing after time t, whereas the C/D ROC is used to distinguish subjects failing by time t from those failing after time t. Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the covariate-specific timedependent ROC curves in the literature. For example, Cai et al. (2006) used generalized linear model concepts to characterize the shape of the ROC curve, allowing covariates to impact accuracy directly. Zheng and Heagerty (2004) modeled the marker distribution for cases and controls as a function of disease status, covariates and disease onset time (cases only), and calculated the induced covariate-specific ROC curves. Song and Zhou (2008) adopted a joint model which assumes that the failure time depends on the biomarker and the covariates through a regression model, and that the biomarker depends on the covariates through a location model. The existing methods on estimating time-dependent ROC functions, with or without covariate adjustment, are mostly developed for settings with complete observations. However, in practice, values of biomarkers are not always observed due to limitations in measuring technology or inhibitive measuring cost. Despite the popularity of the time-dependent ROC modeling, the problem of missing biomarkers has not been well studied. In a related but different setting, Liu, Cai, and Zheng (2012) proposed an inverse probability weighting approach to estimate the predictive values of biomarkers under the case-cohort sampling design, where all cases and a random subset of the full cohort are selected (Prentice, 1986) . They evaluated the accuracy of biomarkers in the absence of covariates. In addition, the weight used to adjust for the selection bias is proportional to the sampling fraction, which is assumed known.\nTo complement the existing work, we consider estimation of covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curves when the missingness process needs to be estimated. To incorporate covariate effects, we consider a joint modeling approach where the failure time depends on the biomarker and the covariates through a proportional hazards model, and the biomarker depends on the covariates through a semiparametric location model (Song and Zhou, 2008) . To handle the missing biomarkers, we propose an inverse probability weighted estimator, where individual contributions are weighted inversely proportional to their selection probabilities. In real data applications, the missingness process is rarely known. To implement the inverse probability weighted estimator, we suggest a parametric approach for the estimation of the missingness process. However, the estimator may result in a large bias, if the model for the missingness process is misspecified. Using the projection method proposed by Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994) , we further propose a fully augmented weighted estimator, in which both the proportional hazards model and the semiparametric location model are augmented. The resulting augmented estimator enjoys the so-called \"double robustness\" property Robins et al. (1994) in the sense that the estimator remains consistent if either the missing data process or the conditional distribution of the biomarkers given the observed data is correctly specified.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose the simple weighted estimators, which require correct specification of the missing data process. In Section 3, we describe the fully augmented estimators, which incorporate information from subjects with incomplete data. In Section 4, we develop large sample properties of the proposed estimators. An extensive simulation study is conducted in Section 5. We illustrate the proposed approach using an Alzheimer's disease study in Section 6. General discussion is included in Section 7."}, {"section_title": "Simple Weighted Estimators", "text": "For subject i = 1, . . . , n, let T i , C i , and R i = min(T i , C i ) denote the failure time, censoring time, and observed time.

For simplicity, we assume that C i and T i are independent given Q i . When multiple biomarkers are available, we combine them into a composite score for disease prediction, and thus Z i could represent a combination of multiple markers. We assume the combination is pre-specified and if one component is missing, the composite score Z i is considered as missing.\nWe assume the failure time T i satisfies the proportional hazards model\nwhere \u03bb 0 (t) is an unspecified baseline hazard function, and\nLet V i be the missingness indicator taking 1 if Z i is observed and 0 otherwise.

To estimate TPR and FPR, we need estimators for S (t|z, x) , f (t|z, x) and P(Z \u2264 z | X = x). Under the proportional hazards model, the survival function is S(t | z, x) = exp{\u2212 0 (t) exp(\u03b2 0 z + \u03b3 0 T x)}, where\n. A variety of methods have been proposed to handle missing covariates in the proportional hazards model, see Paik and Tsai (1997) , Chen and Little (1999) , Wang and Chen (2001) , Wang, Xie, and Prentice (2001) , Qi, Wang, and Prentice (2005) , Xu (2009), Xu et al. (2009) . To fix the idea, we focus on the inverse probability weighted estimating equation approach proposed by Qi et al. (2005) , and indicate that other approaches can be applied as well. Let N i (t) = \u03b4 i I(R i \u2264 t) and Y i (t) = I(R i \u2265 t) be the counting process and the at-risk process for subject i. The simple weighted estimating equation in Qi et al. (2005) is given as\nwhere for k=0, 1, 2, S (k) (\u03b8, t)=n \n. . , n}. Therefore, the weighted estimator for \u03bb 0 (t)dt = d 0 (t) with the plug-in estimator \u03b8 is given by\nWith the plug-in estimators \u03b8 and d 0 (t; \u03b8), we can estimate S(t|z, x) and\n, we further assume a linear regression model,\nwhere i is a zero-mean random variable with unknown distribution function H(\u00b7) and \u03b1 0 is a p-dimensional parameter. The model is equivalent to the semiparametric location model Song and Zhou (2008) . The estimator \u03b1 can be obtained by solving the estimating equation U \u03b1 (\u03b1) = 0, where\nThe unknown distribution function H(z) is estimated by the weighted estimator\nThe resulting ROC estimators are denoted by ROC I/D (p; t, x) and ROC C/D (p; t, x). In practice, the selection probability \u03c0(W i ) is often unknown. To implement the simple weighted estimators, we postulate a parametric model, say \u03c0 i (\u03c6 0 ) = \u03c0(W i ; \u03c6 0 ), to characterize the missing data process, where \u03c6 0 is a finite dimensional parameter. Let (\u03c6) denote the resulting log likelihood, that is,\nThe estimators ( \u03b8 P , \u03c6) can be obtained by simultaneously solving the estimating equations (\nThe corresponding estimator for d 0 (t) is given by\nThe resulting estimators of S(t|z, x), f (t|z, x) are denoted by S P (t|z, x) and f P (t|z, x) ."}, {"section_title": "and the resulting estimator for H(z) is denoted by H P (z).", "text": "Plugging S P (t|z, x), f P (t|z, x) and H P (z) into equations (2)- (4) leads to estimators TPR C P , TPR I P , and FPR D P . For example, TPR C P can be written as\nThe resulting estimators for ROC functions are denoted by"}, {"section_title": "Fully Augmented Weighted Estimators", "text": "While the parametric method in Section 2 provides a flexible scheme for modeling the missing data process, the consistency of the ROC estimators still hinges on the correct specification of the model for \u03c0(W i ). Moreover, the weighted estimating equation approach in Section 2 only utilizes the subjects with complete measurements, which may result in a loss of information. To address these issues, we develop fully augmented weighted estimators of ROC. The key idea is to project the corresponding estimating equations constructed in Section 2 onto the orthogonal complement of the tangent space for the nuisance missing data process, and then construct new estimating equations by removing redundant information Robins et al. (1994) . For theoretical presentation, for now we assume \u03c0(W i ) and f (Z i |X i ) are given. Following Qi et al. (2005) , we estimate \u03b8 by solving the following augmented estimating equations\nwhere for k = 0, 1, 2,\nNote that the subjects with missing biomarkers contribute to U A (\u03b8) in two ways, one through the augmentation term A A i (\u03b8) and the other through the risk set weighted average S\nIt is easily seen that, if \u03c0 is correctly specified, equation (8) is unbiased even if f (Z i |W i ) is mis-specified. On the other hand, if f (Z i |W i ) is mis-specified, equation (8) is also unbiased even if \u03c0 is incorrectly specified. Therefore, the augmented estimator \u03b8 A , obtained by solving U A (\u03b8) = 0, enjoys the so-called \"double robustness\" property (Robins et al., 1994; Wang and Chen, 2001 ). In addition, under proportional hazards model, it can be shown that\nwhere f (Z i |X i ) follows the semiparametric location model (6). We assume validity of the proportional hazards model and allow for arbitrary error distribution in the location model. Therefore, in our context, \u03b8 A is doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent if either \u03c0(W i ) or f (Z i |X i ) is correctly specified.\nTo construct doubly robust estimators of ROC functions, we develop augmented weighted estimators of d 0 (t), \u03b1 and H(z), respectively. Following the same principle, we give the following augmented estimator of d 0 (t):\nIn contrast to the simple weighted estimator\nA (\u03b8, t) that incorporates information from incomplete observations. In addition, in (11), the counting processes dN i (t) are averaged over all subjects, whereas in (5), dN i (t) are averaged over subjects with complete observations. In Web Appendix B, we show that d A 0 (t; \u03b8 A ) also has the double robustness property. By plugging in d A 0 (t; \u03b8 A ) and \u03b8 A , the resulting estimators of S(t|z, x) and f (t|z, x)dt are denoted by S A (t|z, x) and\nSimilarly, the augmented weighted estimating equation for \u03b1 is\nPlugging S A (t|z, x), f A (t|z, x) and H A (z) into equations (2)-(4) leads to estimators TPR C (c; t, x), TPR I (c; t, x) and\nThe resulting estimators for ROC functions are denoted by ROC I/D (p; t, x) and ROC C/D (p; t, x).\nOur estimation procedures are fully augmented in the sense that the estimating equations and estimators\nTherefore the resulting estimators of ROC functions are also doubly robust. One problem with the augmented estimators is that it does not guarantee the TPR and FPR functions are monotone, because of some negative weighting of the data points induced by the (1 \u2212 V i /\u03c0 i ) term (Alonzo and Pepe, 2005) . Our numerical studies show that the augmented estimators do not show dramatic deviation from monotonicity, therefore, the non-monotonicity is not a major concern in this manuscript.\nThe above augmented estimation approach assumes \u03c0(W i ), 0 (t) and f (Z i |X i ) are given, while all of them are usually unknown in practice. Qi et al. (2005) proposed a nonparametric approach to estimate the unknown functions. However, their approach is not applicable in the presence of high dimensional X i due to the curse of dimensionality. In this manuscript, we consider a parametric approach to estimate those functions. As illustrated in Section 2, we can postulate a parametric model for \u03c0(W i ), say \u03c0 i (\u03c6 0 ) = \u03c0(W i ; \u03c6 0 ). Similarly, we assume a parametric distribution for the error term i in the semiparametric location model for Z i |X i . Note that this assumption is not needed for the simple weighted estimator H P , because it has the form of a weighted empirical estimator. On the contrary, the augmented estimator H A involves estimation of f (Z i |W i ), thus further assumption is required. H A remains consistent if either one of the two parametric models for \u03c0 and f (Z i | X i ) is correctly specified.\nAssume that the parametric distribution for i is indexed by \u03b7 0 , and let Sc(\ndenote the score function for \u03b7. The expression of the augmented estimator also requires an estimator for d 0 (t), and we denote it by d 0 (t, \u03c6). The choice of d 0 (t, \u03c6) will be discussed later. Let \u03c7 0 = (\u03b8 0 , \u03b1 0 , \u03c6 0 , \u03b7 0 ). As a result of replacing 0 (t) with 0 (t, \u03c6), E(\u00b7 | W i ) in (9), (10), and (12) is denoted by E(\u00b7 | W i ; \u03c7), and the estimated S\nA (\u03c7, t)\nThe parameters \u03c7 can be estimated by solving U AP (\u03c7) = 0, and the resulting estimators are denoted by ( \u03b8 AP , \u03b1 AP , \u03c6, \u03b7) . Similarly, the augmented estimator of d 0 (t) is given by \u03c6, \u03b7, t) . where S (0) A (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b7, t) is given in equation (9) with parameterized \u03c0(W i ) and\n; \u03c7}, which is obtained with the plug-in estimator \u03b7. The augmented estimator of H(z) is given by\nRecall that the estimators AP 0 , H AP , and \u03c6, \u03b7 depend on the choice of d 0 in E(\u00b7 | W i ; \u03c7). One choice is the simple weighted estimator given in (7). However, if \u03c0(W i , \u03c6) is misspecified, the simple weighted estimator can deviate from the truth, which leads to incorrect estimation of E and biased estimation of ( 0 , H, \u03c6, \u03b7). To address this issue, we estimate the parameters based on an EM-type iterative algorithm following similar ideas of Wang and Chen (2001) and Zheng, Barlow, and Cutter (2005) . First, we calculate the estimators AP 0 , H AP , \u03c6 and \u03b7 with the initial estimator d 0 (t) in (7). Second, we update 0 (t) using "}, {"section_title": "Inference in Large Samples", "text": "In this section, we outline theoretical results for the proposed estimators. As shown in Section 2, the ROC functions depend on both \u03b8 and 0 (t). The asymptotics of the estimators for \u03b8 have been established under various missing data processes (Wang and Chen, 2001; Qi et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2009) . However, to the best of our knowledge, the asymptotics of 0 (t) in the presence of missing data remain largely unexplored. As a byproduct of our asymptotic results, we derive the limiting distributions of a variety of estimators for 0 (t). Therefore, our results complement the existing works in the literature.\nIn Lemmas 1 and 3 in Web Appendix B, we establish the large sample properties of 0 (t; \u03b8) and P 0 (t; \u03b8 P , \u03c6).

For theoretical presentation, we assume \u03c0 and f (Z i |W i ) are known.\nIn Web Appendix B, we show that Theorem 4 implies that estimation of \u03c0(W i ) and f (Z i | X i ) does not affect the asymptotic properties of the augmented estimators.

We consider two sets of simulation scenarios, with different missingness probabilities for the biomarker Z i .\nUnder the first simulation setting, the selection probability is \u03c0 i = 0.7\u03b4 i + 0.3(1 \u2212 \u03b4 i ), which results in 46% of missingness. Table 1 exhibits the results for the various estimators under the first simulation scenario. Bias is the empirical bias. SE denotes the square root of the sample variance of the estimates. ASE denotes the average of the standard error estimates using methods discussed in Web Appendix E. The 95% coverage probability is constructed using ASE. For the estimators with \u03c0, \u03c0 is estimated as a function of W by fitting the logistic regression, thus the missing data process is correctly specified. The complete-case analysis yields large bias because the selection probability is strongly associated with the outcome variable \u03b4. All remaining estimators show negligible bias, which agrees with the consistency properties of SWE and AWE under the correctly specified missing data model. Comparing the efficiency of the proposed estimators, we find that SWE-\u03c0, AWE-\u03c0-f Z|X , and AWE-\u03c0-f Z|X have comparable efficiency with SWE-\u03c0. Note that, although it can be shown that ( \u03b8 P , \u03b1 P , P 0 , H P ) and ( \u03b8 A , \u03b1 A , A 0 , H A ) have higher efficiency than ( \u03b8, \u03b1, , H) , this result may not be generalizable to the ROC estimators, because TPR and FPR are nonlinear functions of (\u03b8, \u03b1, 0 , H), and the correlation among the estimators of (\u03b8, \u03b1, 0 , H) is difficult to characterize. This explains why we do not observe a substantial efficiency gain of AWE-\u03c0-f Z|X over SWE-\u03c0. The augmented estimator with misspecified Z|X, AWE-\u03c0-f Z|X 1 , is also unbiased due to its double robustness property, but it shows larger SE than its competitors. For unbiased estimators, the estimated standard errors track the empirical standard errors well, and the coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level.

For the purpose of comparison, we report estimators with misspecified \u03c0 i , where \u03c0 i is estimated using logistic regression with \u03b4 i as covariate only, and also estimators with correctly specified \u03c0 i , where \u03c0 i is estimated using logistic regression with covari-\nThe simulation results are summarized in Table 2 . Similar to the first setting, the complete-case analysis leads to biased results. In addition, SWE-\u03c0(\u03b4) also To further explore the performances of the SWE and AWE, we compare the estimated TPR and FPR using different approaches in Table 3 . The same conclusion is drawn. In particular, SWE-\u03c0(\u03b4) yields substantial bias in TPR I , TPR C and FPR, while the augmented estimators show small bias for all these quantities. Additional simulation results with varying sample sizes, censoring rates, missing proportions, and a nonconstant baseline hazard rate can be found in Web Appendix F.\nIn summary, we find that the AWE is consistent provided one of the models for \u03c0 and Z|X is correctly specified. In addition, AWE achieves similar or higher efficiency than SWE-\u03c0, and its standard errors and confidence intervals can be well approximated using the resampling methods. These observations hold for both ROC and TPR, FPR estimation.

The study is supported by the NIH, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations. Enrollment target was 800 participants, including 400 subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD and 200 elderly control subjects. Participants were enrolled on a rolling basis, and were evaluated every 6 months. One of the major goals of the ADNI study is to identify biomarkers that are associated with progression from MCI to AD. Sensitivity and specificity were considered important statistical techniques for assessing biomarkers in the disease progression. We analyze the dataset for the 393 MCI patients, using onset of AD as the event outcome. The biomarkers include cognition, genetics, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, which are subject to missing values. Patient demographics, such as age, gender, education and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), are completely observed. To illustrate our approach, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the neuroimaging biomarkers, while adjusting for age and ApoE. We consider two neuroimaging biomarkers: hippocampus volume and ventricular volume, because both hippocampus and ventricle are primary brain regions that modulate cognitive function. To avoid overestimation, we use a predefined rule (take the difference) to combine the two biomarkers after standardization.

We then estimate the ROC curves using the simple weighted estimator, the augmented weighted estimator as well as the complete-case analysis, with \u03c0 estimated from the selected logistic regression model. The upper panels of Figure 1 exhibit the estimated cumulative ROC curves evaluated at t = 24 months, for individuals of 75 years old with ApoE4 positive and ApoE4 negative respectively. The lower panels of Figure 1 present the corresponding incident ROC curves. It appears that the estimated ROC curves and the 95% pointwise confidence intervals (CIs) using three approaches are very close. For clarity of presentation, we only show the CIs of the augmented estimator. Though the estimated ROC curves are similar using all three approaches, the estimated TPR and FPR show some differences. Specifically, as shown in Table 4 , the complete-case estimator yields lower TPR and FPR than the other two estimators. Because sensitivity (TPR) and specificity (1 \u2212 FPR) are the most clinically relevant quantities in AD research, it is important to find an estimator that is unbiased in these quantities. We advocate the use of the augmented weighted estimator, because it is more robust to model misspecification.\nIn the following, we summarize the analytical results obtained from the augmented estimator. The cumulative ROC curves show that the combined marker has moderate capacity for discriminating 75 years old MCI individuals who would experience AD in the next 24 months from those who would not. In particular, the estimated AUC is 0.69 (CI: 0.63-0.75) for the ApoE4 positive group, and 0.66 (CI: 0.61-0.70) for the ApoE4 negative group. For the incident ROC curves, the estimated AUC is 0.64 (CI: 0.60-0.68) for the ApoE4 positive group, and 0.63 (CI: 0.59-0.67) for the ApoE4 negative group. Figure 2 shows the AUC as a function of time using different estimators. The C/D AUC is slightly increasing over time, suggesting that the combined marker has higher accuracy in predicting late onset of AD. The difference of C/D AUC in the two ApoE groups shows the impact of ApoE4 on the classification accuracy of the biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Missing biomarker problem is commonly encountered in timeto-event data. Existing methods on estimating the timedependent accuracy measures of biomarkers are mainly developed for complete data. In the presence of missing biomarkers, the naive complete-case analysis may lead to inconsistent and inefficient estimation. Therefore, it is urgent to develop estimation procedures that account for the missingness effect. The proposed simple weighted estimators correct the bias by inversely weighting each completely observed subject by its selection probability, and they are shown to be consistent when the selection probability is correctly specified. Furthermore, we propose augmented weighted estimators which are robust against misspecification of the selection probability. Both theoretical and numerical results suggest that the augmented weighted estimator outperforms the complete-case analysis and the simple weighted estimator, because it remains consistent if either the selection probability or the missing data given the observed data is correctly specified, and it often has comparable or improved efficiency than the other estimators. We suggest the use of the augmented weighted estimators, especially when the selection probability is unknown.\nIn addition to studying biomarker accuracy at a given time point t, it is often of interest to evaluate the biomarker's overall predictive accuracy. Heagerty and Zheng (2005) proposed a global summary measure for the time-dependent ROC curve, which is defined as: C = P(Z j > Z k |T j < T k ). To incorporate covariate effect, we extend their definition to a covariate-specific summary measure: C x = P(Z j > Z k |T j < T k , X j = X k = x). C x characterizes the probability that, among subjects with covariate values x, those who fail at an earlier time have larger marker values. To estimate this summary measure, we write it as C x = 2 t AUC I/D (t | x)f (t | x)S(t | x)dt, where AUC I/D can be estimated by numerical integration under the I/D ROC curves, and f (t | x), S(t | x) can be estimated under both the location model and the proportional hazards model. We have established augmented estimators for each component, thus the resulting estimator for C x also inherits the double robustness property.\nThere are several directions for future research. First, in this manuscript, we assume the covariates are fully observed. It would be of interest to extend our method to accommodate missingness in both biomarkers Z i and covariates X i , where X i can be partitioned into fully observed covariates X c i and covariates subject to missingness X m i . Second, we have confined our attention to right censored survival data. In practice, it might be challenging for clinicians to identify exact time of disease onset, thus the survival outcomes might be subject to interval censoring. It is an important extension to study biomarker accuracy under both missingness in biomarkers and interval censoring in survival outcomes. Finally, the proposed ROC estimation approaches are built on the proportional hazards model. To relax the model assumption, one can consider more flexible models such as the semiparametric transformation model. Further investigation is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Materials", "text": "Web Appendices, Tables referenced in Sections 3, 4, 5, and the R code implementing the new methods are available with this paper at the Biometrics website on Wiley Online Library."}]
