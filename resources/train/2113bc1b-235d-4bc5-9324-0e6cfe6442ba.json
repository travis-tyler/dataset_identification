[{"section_title": "Aerial photograph of Avery Point", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "A series of coastal climate change adaptation workshops were held in Groton, Connecticut throughout 2010. The workshops were designed to convene federal, state, and local government, as well as academic, non-profit, and community partners to develop a model for coastal community adaptation planning in a \"home rule\" state. In addition to fostering vertical collaboration between levels of government, the process allowed horizontal coordination within each level that resulted in innovative collaborations. The key stakeholders involved, the commitment from supporting and sponsoring agencies, and the cutting-edge science and economic modeling presented all worked to make the process successful. While a 500-year storm event that occurred on March 30, 2010 almost cancelled the second workshop, the washed out and flooded roads and bridges illustrated that 1) climate impacts are already costing multiple levels of government large amounts of money; 2) locals already know much of how and where they are vulnerable; and 3) there is a need to work towards solutions immediately to avoid additional unnecessary costs and risk. While Groton and state and federal government agencies are continuing the adaptation processes that were initiated during these workshops, it will take additional and continued stakeholder involvement and support for coordinated and successful adaptation to occur. This report speaks to other lessons learned and contains insight and resources so other communities (especially coastal communities) can begin or continue their adaptation planning process. Materials from these workshops (i.e. presentations, agendas) can be found here."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Prominently featured in the October 10, 2010 report of the Interagency Climate Adaptation Task Force is that \"coordination and collaboration is necessary between all levels of government and stakeholders\" to build a more resilient nation. Intergovernmental coordination is critically important to the northeast because the New England states operate under a form of \"home rule\" in which the states have legislatively granted authority to towns to pass laws and ordinances. This means that the majority of land use decisions are made by town boards such as planning or zoning boards/commissions. States retain certain authorities such as in Connecticut, where the Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP) has been granted the authority to require permits for all activity taking place below the high tide line. Many of these same activities also require permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Recognizing the importance of multi-governmental collaboration in regards to building resilience, through the Long Island Sound Study, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability USA (ICLEI) and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP) partnered with the Groton, Connecticut to conduct an analysis of how and if federal, state, and local stakeholders could collaborate to enhance resilience towards climate change at the local level. The Long Island Sound Study (LISS) is a National Estuary Program and is eligible for EPA grants under a new climate change initiative called Climate Ready Estuaries. The CT DEP Office of Long Island Sound Programs (OLISP) devised the project concept and received approval from the LISS to develop an application. It was proposed that ICLEI be engaged to be the lead in organizing the workshops and also to share their experience with regards to introducing municipalities to adaptation planning. Funding for this project was provided by the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Participants at the first Groton Workshop", "text": "Environmental Protection Agency through the \"Climate Ready Estuaries\" program. The Climate Ready Estuaries program works with the National Estuary Programs and other coastal managers to: 1) assess climate change vulnerabilities; 2) develop and implement adaptation strategies; 3) engage and educate stakeholders; and 4) share the lessons learned with other coastal managers 1 . This project advanced these four priorities through a lens that focuses on coastal climate change issues at the local level, with a focus on intergovernmental cooperation and identifying roles to foster resilience at all levels. The project\"s main aims were to: \uf0b7 Understand how to prioritize vulnerabilities so that lawmakers have a framework to utilize when selecting projects that are competing for limited financial resources; \uf0b7 Determine if and how existing laws and regulations need to consider future rates of sea level rise and erosion in order to protect the priority vulnerable areas that sustain the local, state, and regional economies; \uf0b7 Identify synergies and begin fostering collaboration between all levels of government in order to increase local resilience towards climate related vulnerabilities; and \uf0b7 Share lessons learned through the process with other communities in the region. Groton was selected as the geographic focus of this project because: \uf0b7 The town has taken steps to address pressing challenges, most notably the Town Council creation of a Task Force on \"Climate Change and Sustainable Communities\" to develop strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation; \uf0b7 Groton offered a unique mix of federal, state and municipal coastal climate changes issues, including inundation from sea level rise at the Navy Base, Groton-New London Airport, Groton Reservoir, state parks such as Bluff Point, vulnerable commercial areas such as downtown Mystic and developed coastal barrier beaches; and \uf0b7 Lessons learned from Groton would provide valuable guidance to the Governor\"s Steering Committee on Adaptation working groups, especially Infrastructure and Natural Resources, and be replicable by other municipalities throughout the Northeast. The remainder of this document describes the process, results, and recommended next steps for Groton as well as other municipalities interested in initiating an adaptation effort. This report does not represent the end of adaptation planning for Groton but is instead a summary of their process to-date and guidance for their next steps, as well as next steps for State and Federal entities in the journey to building local resilience towards climate change."}, {"section_title": "Process", "text": "In order to foster collective understanding of vulnerabilities and potential actions to increase resilience towards climate change in Groton, the project team organized three workshops -one each focusing on: \uf0b7 The climate adaptation planning process and projected global, regional and local climate changes; \uf0b7 Identification of vulnerabilities from projected changes in global and regional climate; and \uf0b7 Identification of potential actions that could be used to increase resilience towards existing and projected changes in global and regional climate. Over 100 individuals attended the workshop series, including representatives from federal government, regional entities, state agencies, the Town, academia, private corporations, and residential groups (Appendix Two). The aim of the project was to bring these disparate groups together to evaluate and advance understanding around how Groton is vulnerable to climate change (in particular, sea level rise) and to work collaboratively to begin devising strategies for increasing the Town\"s resilience. This process was also intended to serve as a model for other local governments across the Northeast, documenting lessons learned, best practices, and to the extent relevant, replicable models other local communities could employ when undertaking climate adaptation planning. Even though nearby towns were not able to participate in this project (due to size constraints), the project team made concerted efforts to empower others to replicate the Groton process and recommends Groton share their lessons and progress with their neighboring communities to enhance and leverage efforts.

The least erodible is bedrock o As fetch increases, so does the rate of erosion since 1980 to approximately 4 mm/yr, which is more in other areas; and \uf0b7 Tidal marsh migrationnumerous examples from around the coast indicate an accelerated rate of tidal marsh migration onto the uplands."}, {"section_title": "Future Changes in Climate Likely to Affect the Northeast", "text": "Dr. Kirshen and Dr. Gutierrez further elaborated on projected future climate change, highlighting those changes that could affect the Northeast region, including: \uf0b7 A total of 80 days over 90 o F in Hartford, by late-century, under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario; the number of days over 100 o F could increase to 28 by late-century compared to 2 days currently on average, over 100 o F. \uf0b7 The southern and western parts of the Northeast could experience as few as 5 to 10 snow-covered days in winter, compared with 10 to 45 days historically. \uf0b7 Conservatively, global sea-levels could rise by 3 feet (1 meter) by the end of the 21 st century. \uf0b7 Precipitation intensity is projected to increase 8 to 9 percent by mid-century, and 10 to 15 percent by the end of the century. \uf0b7 The number of heavy precipitation events is projected to increase by 8 percent by mid-century, and 12 to 13 percent by the end of the century. \uf0b7 By the end of the century, short-term droughts are projected to occur annually in Connecticut, under a higher greenhouse gas emissions scenario. \uf0b7 Increases in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease. \uf0b7 Increase in pollen allergens. \uf0b7 Significant shifts in fisheries ranges and numbers for a variety of species, including economically valuable cod and lobster. \uf0b7 Ecosystem shifts in elevation and latitudewhich could lead to habitat loss or change, and extinctions (up to 30% extinction rate with an additional 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature ((1 to 3 degree Celsius))."}, {"section_title": "Climate-Related Vulnerabilities Identified for the Town of Groton", "text": "Once Dr. Kirshen, Dr. Gutierrez, and Ron Rozsa had a chance to present on existing and future climate and weather related effects in the Northeast and in the State of Connecticut, participants had the opportunity to share their thoughts and perspectives about existing impacts. This part of the workshop was critical as it allowed participants to understand how they are already vulnerable to weather and climate. This understanding was necessary in order to build momentum and support for planning for future climate and weather impacts (workshop two). When assessing existing and future climate vulnerabilities, participants used weather and climate information provided by Drs. Kirshen and Gutierrez, as well as information from a new tool called COAST. COAST is a tool being developed by the New England Environmental Finance Center (EFC) with the support of Battelle Memorial Institute and focuses on helping decision makers assess costs and benefits of adapting to sea level rise. The COAST tool incorporates a variety of existing data sets including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Depth-Damage functions, NOAA\"s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model and other flood methods, projected sea level rise scenarios over time, property values, and infrastructure costs, into a comprehensive GIS-based picture of potential economic damage. It assists coastal municipalities in selecting adaptation actions by displaying the implementation costs and location-specific avoided costs associated with particular adaptation actions. Based on scientific information combined with the modeling done through the COAST tool and participant knowledge about existing and projected future climate impacts, workshop participants identified the following as specific climate related impacts likely to affect Groton: \uf0b7 More frequent river and coastal flooding; \uf0b7 Increased occurrence of sewer overflows; \uf0b7 Loss of coastal habitats and resources (wetlands); \uf0b7 Increased coastal erosion; \uf0b7 Reduced drinking water quality and supply caused by salt water intrusion as well as increased precipitation, flooding, drought, and erosion; \uf0b7 More frequent flooding that could prevent access to and reduce function of Groton-New London Airport; \uf0b7 Access to state parks such as Bluff Point and Haley Farm could be hampered by flooding; \uf0b7 Access to UCONN-Avery Point campus may be impaired during storm events; \uf0b7 Docks and marina facilities could be damaged by flooding and sea level rise; \uf0b7 Increased economic impacts related to infrastructure replacements, loss of employment hours, additional emergency service personnel, and others arising from no action scenarios; \uf0b7 Sections of Amtrak railroad could flood under certain sea level rise and storm flooding scenarios; \uf0b7 Mystic River bridge may experience additional openings for smaller boats as bridge clearance diminishes with sea level rise; \uf0b7 Shellfishing and fish spawning could be drastically reduced and/or collapse; and \uf0b7 Overall quality of life, aesthetics, and enjoyment of citizens may be reduced.

As such, the project team worked to ensure that stakeholders working on existing adaptation efforts that affected the Groton region were invited to the three-part workshop series. Examples of some related efforts that already existed and that informed the Groton process include: to launch a Connecticut Climate Network for municipalities. This network will facilitate information exchange between local communities and will be instrumental in the design of ART. \uf0b7 During the final Groton workshop, participants were asked to make a single commitment to what they would do to help build resilience towards climate change through their professional or personal capacities. Todate, many Groton attendees have held true to the individual commitments, resulting in even more mitigation and adaptation efforts.

The process needs to respect existing budget and staff demands currently placed on Town departments while also being inclusive and participatory. \u2022 Pursue funding sources at CT DEP, Clean Energy Fund, and others to increase municipal capacity when staff and resources are limited. \u2022 Work with the Town  Administration  to  establish  a  working  climate preparedness committee, including municipal department heads and other key technical personnel, to evaluate community vulnerabilities, establish preparedness targets, and prioritize actions. \u2022 Create a Town-wide climate action plan that includes strategies to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare for climate change impacts. Be sure to identify strategies that are robust, adjustable, align with existing community priorities, and provide co-benefits. \u2022 Engage CT DOT and Councils of Government to discuss altering criteria for funding of STP-URBAN program and other infrastructure grants to incorporate adaptation criteria. \u2022 Integrate climate change considerations into all Town-wide planning (i.e. master, community, revitalization, capital improvement, etc.). \u2022 Provide staff to serve on the Adaptation Resource Toolkit Steering Committee to help share lessons learned in Groton and to learn about new and existing adaptation tools and resources that can help the Town move forward with building resilience towards climate change. \u2022 Continue refinement of an outreach strategy regarding climate preparedness and deliver preparedness messages to the public and stakeholders via resources and programming at the library, other regular Town communication channels, and other innovative outreach techniques. \u2022 Continue researching what others are doing and share information regionally. The Naval Submarine Base in Groton has an adaptation strategy, and there are many communities worldwide who have started implementation of adaptation strategies as well. Groton staff should identify existing resources that can assist in their planning needs, and share lessons learned with their neighboring towns and regionally when applicable."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for State, Federal and other Stakeholders", "text": "This section includes recommendations for adaptation work that should be continued and/or started by state, federal, academics and non-governmental organization, including: \uf0b7 The state and federal real estate in Groton and beyond need vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans. Development of these plans will require funding and data. \uf0b7 While some high quality modeling and data exists, work still needs to be done to enhance our understanding of climate impacts. Funds are essential to provide all levels of government with the requisite data for adaptation planning. Funds wisely spent in advance would keep down impacts and associated costs. Specific examples of modeling include but are not limited to: Sentinel Monitoring of Climate Change in Long Island Sound which is using monitoring data and expert scientists to identify how climate is changing to inform adaptation strategies; completion of the UConn Surge model including integrating wave heights; short term deployment of wave buoys in key near-shore zones so that the data are available to identify appropriate flood and erosion control responses; modeling to identify how sea level rise will alter the tidal characteristics of Long Island Sound since the geometry of the Sound may magnify the effect of sea level rise; and better modeling of species and ecosystem impacts. \uf0b7 Great partnerships were formed or strengthened though the workshop processes that have the potential for manifesting unprecedented adaptation planning results. These partnerships should be supported and formalized as they coordinate and leverage existing efforts, and can serve as models for others. Some examples include the federal and bi-state (CT and NY) Sentinel Monitoring for Climate Change in Long Island Sound efforts, the DOT discussions with local, federal and state partners including DEP to explore and remedy impacts to transportation infrastructure, and the OLISP formation of an internal climate change group to examine existing policies and procedure with respect to adaptation. \uf0b7 If not already in motion, CT DEP and CT DOT should develop a working group to continue to explore the likely impacts of climate change to transportation infrastructure along the shore. \uf0b7 Currently the Flood Control and Beach Erosion Act requires municipalities to establish Flood and Erosion Control Boards in order to access state funding for flood and erosion control projects. It\"s highly recommended that these groups use future projections in sea level rise and changes in coastal storms to evaluate their risk. Where needed, the legislature should provide funding to assist in the evaluation of adaptation planning for shoreline areas. \uf0b7 State and Federal agencies should undertake an analysis of existing programs/laws to evaluate if these create impediments to address the most urgent/pressing local resiliency issues. If impediments exist, efforts should be taken to remove or lessen those barriers."}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned", "text": "Throughout this year-long process, numerous invaluable lessons were learned which will not only help Groton continue its momentum in building local preparedness towards climate change, but which will also be instrumental in helping other communities replicate the work done in Groton. These lessons include:"}, {"section_title": "A. Importance of open and clear lines of communication combined with the value of face-to-face meetings", "text": "Understanding a community\"s vulnerability and building resilience towards climate change will require the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. Traditionally, many of the stakeholders critical for this process are stakeholders that do not have a long history of collaboration. Recognizing this, having clear, open, and well thought out channels for communication are critical for ensuring all voices are heard, respected, and involved in the adaptation process. Moreover, experience has demonstrated that face-to-face meetings and engagement can provide significantly more value than remote communication (assuming the time spent face-to-face is well structured.) This was a critical piece of the Groton process and while we strove to increase collaboration between federal-state-regional-and local stakeholders, one of the unique things that came out of this project was collaboration at the federal-federal, state-state, and local-level level. This type of collaboration would have either not happened or been extremely limited if the group did not have the opportunity to meet face-to-face."}, {"section_title": "B. Importance of working with non-traditional partners", "text": "Building resilience towards climate change will involve working with multiple individuals, agencies, and organizations that are critical to making a community function. This includes working with entities that are not traditionally involved in decision-makingsuch as vulnerable populations, real-estate developments, insurers, and non-profit partners. In messaging to groups, it is crucial to consider their concerns. The Groton process provide a window into how important the building of new partnerships and relationships was and will continue to be in helping communities prepare for climate change."}, {"section_title": "C. Start with Existing Community Vulnerabilities", "text": "Many communities are already experience weather and climate related vulnerabilities today. Instead of focusing on what your community might be like in 2050 or 2100, local communities should start their climate conversations by focusing on today\"s vulnerabilities and how climate change could exacerbate and/or create new vulnerabilities in the future. This has proven to be a more effective way to engage stakeholders and audiences in the resilience building process."}, {"section_title": "D. Value of Assessing Vulnerability", "text": "In a world of limited budgets and capacity, having information that allows communities to identify which systems or areas within their community are the most vulnerable to climate change is important. A vulnerability assessment is a way for communities to gain this insight. Vulnerability assessments allow communities to take information on existing and projected changes in climate and analyze how those changes will affect them. Vulnerability assessments can be extremely detailed or very general. The level or rigor of the analysis depends on the needs and abilities of the local community 7 . The Groton process combined multiple types of modeling (CHAMP for coastal communities, UCONN Surge Modeling, HAZUS, COAST, etc.) as well as local observation of the current problem areas (road and other areas vulnerable to flooding) to establish a preliminary and low cost vulnerability assessment. State and federal staff also provided input and expertise for areas of critical interest, such as transportation. This process can be replicated in other towns by pulling together existing resources, staff and experts. It is likely that other communities will discover that there are existing resources and initiatives that could be merged/enhanced and further built upon at little cost. In absence of any modeling, COAST and other tools demonstrated that to estimate future impacts, you can roughly equate them to today\"s large event happening more frequently in the future (i.e. expect today\"s 500 year storms to be the future 100 or 50 year storms)."}, {"section_title": "E. Importance of Planning with Imperfect Information", "text": "While our ability to understand future climate is improving, science will never be able to tell us with 100% accuracy exactly what the climate will be like in 2050. However, even without this information, local communities can begin planning for existing and likely future climate impacts. The Groton model of pulling together the climate experts to provide guidance on what future climate could be like and discussing a range of potential impacts with stakeholders was extremely useful as it provided an opportunity for stakeholders to brainstorm and reflect on what impacts could be in their area of expertise. Stakeholders did not get caught up in the exact range of future changes (i.e. what exactly will the average daily temperature be in 2050), but instead focused on planning for a range of future scenarios."}, {"section_title": "F. Value of Cross-Sector Collaboration", "text": "When assessing vulnerability, a natural tendency is to bring together experts in each system to speak about vulnerabilities (i.e. public health officials talking to one another about public health vulnerabilities). However, the Groton process demonstrated that bringing together people with various types of expertise to discuss issues led to more thoughtful discussion and the identification of sometimes complex vulnerabilities."}, {"section_title": "F. Challenges of Truly Valuing Ecosystems", "text": "When exploring vulnerabilities and identifying strategies for increasing resilience, participants in the Groton process articulated a challenge with estimating the true value of ecosystems. For example, not only do beaches, dunes and wetlands act as a storm surge and sea level rise buffers, but they have economic value as well since coastal Connecticut generates substantial tourism and aquaculture revenue. The beauty and resources available are also a reason property values are so high in coastal areas. Strategies such as armoring the shoreline, which might have been recommended if one merely strove to protect existing infrastructure, will destroy that natural function and degrade the wetlands. While the Groton process did not identify a solution to this problem, participants regularly articulated a need to have a better process to understand the true value of ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "G. Challenges in Removing Perverse Incentives to Build in Vulnerable Places", "text": "In coastal communities across the United States some of the most valuable real estate is located in close proximity to the coast. Continuing to live and build in extremely vulnerable locations creates both a financial challenge but also can create a public safety situation. For example, homes located in a flood plain or that have a primary point of access that regularly floods may experience limited to no public safety support in case of an emergency if emergency personnel are physically unable to access the site. Furthermore, debris from homes can further damage other infrastructure in a storm surge, as evidenced by past storm events. However, these homes are often the most expensive homes in a community and provide an important tax base for the city/town. This creates a conundrum for local communities and is something that numerous entities are striving to devise answers to 8 . Complicating this issue is the tendency of people to underinsure or not insure because they perceive that someone else, generally the government, will compensate them for their loss."}, {"section_title": "H. The Importance of Regional Collaboration", "text": "While the Groton process focused on working across geo-political boundaries to build the Town\"s resilience towards climate change, one of the key revelations from this project was the realization that true adaptation needs to happen at the local, regional, and state level. The reason for this is that many areas likely to be affected by climate change are managed at a regional or sub-regional level. For example, the Town of Groton has limited ability to act to increase the resilience of its roads to existing and increased flooding. However, the State Department of Transportation has more authority to act. Recognizing this, local communities will need to engage surrounding municipalities, counties or regional planning agencies, and relevant state agencies to collaborate to truly build resilience towards climate change."}]
