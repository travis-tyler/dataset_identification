There is considerable policy interest in learning how ability tracking affects different types of students, and how policy changes, such as changing proficiency standards, would affect schools' tracking choices and the distribution of student achievement. However, these questions are also very hard to answer. Indeed, the determinants and effects of tracking remain largely open questions, as evidenced by the mixed findings in the literature. Carefully-designed experiments can potentially answer these questions. However, to learn the effects of tracking, experiments would have to be conducted on a representative distribution of schools, because, as Gamoran and Hallinan (1995) point out, the effectiveness of tracking depends on how it is implemented and on the school climate in which it is implemented. Similarly, to the extent that different policies may have very different impacts, one would need to run experiments under an extensive range of potential policies. The cost of doing so can become formidable very fast.\nAs a feasible alternative, we adopt a structural approach. We develop and estimate a model that treats a school's tracking regime and track-specific effort, parental effort, and student achievement as joint equilibrium outcomes. The model is designed to address three interrelated components which have yet to be considered in a cohesive framework. First, changing peer composition in one classroom necessarily involves student re-allocation, hence changes peers in some other classroom(s). It is important not to treat classrooms in isolation when studying the treatment effect of changing peers, especially for policy making purposes, which require a balance between trade-offs. Second, by explicitly modeling school and parental effort inputs, we can then infer what these input levels and student achievement would be if tracking regimes, hence peer compositions, were changed. This allows us to decompose the effect of tracking into the direct effect of changes in peers and the indirect effects caused by the behavioral responses of schools and parents. As argued by Becker and Tomes (1976) , ignoring behavioral responses may bias estimated impacts of policy changes, which means that taking them into account is critical for policymaking. Finally, our explicit modeling of tracking regime choices allows us to predict how tracking regimes, which determine classroom-level peer composition, and subsequent school and parent inputs would change in response to a policy change.\nIn the model, each school is attended by children from different types of households, the distribution of which may differ between schools. A household type is defined by the child's ability and by how costly it is for the parent to help her child learn. A child's achievement depends on her own ability, effort inputs invested by the school and by her parent, and the quality of her peers.\n3 A parent maximizes her child's achievement by choosing costly parental effort given both her child's track assignment (which determines peer quality) and the effort invested by the school."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Taking into account responses by parents, the school chooses a tracking regime, which assigns students to classrooms based on their ability, and track-specific effort inputs to maximize its own objective, which increases in the average achievement of its students and the fraction of students satisfying a proficiency standard. This framework naturally allows policies to produce winners and losers because changes in tracking regimes at a school may differentially affect students of different ability levels and parental backgrounds. Moreover, given that the model allows schools to base tracking decisions on the composition of attendant households, policies that affect schools' tracking decisions will necessarily create heterogeneous effects at the school level. That is, there will be a distribution of treatment effects within each school, and this distribution may itself differ across schools.\nWe estimate the model using data from the nationwide Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), which are rich enough to allow us to model the interactions between schools and parents. Students are linked to their parents and teachers. For students, we observe prior test scores, class membership, and end-of-the-year test scores. Parents report the frequencies with which they help their children with homework (parental effort). Teachers report the class-specific workload (school effort), and, as a unique feature of the survey, teachers also report the overall level of ability among students in each of their classes relative to other students in the same school. This rare last piece of information (available for multiple classes) allows us to essentially \"observe\" two of the key components of the model. The first is the tracking regime used by each school. The second is the composition of peer ability in each track. Each track comprises a section of the school-specific ability distribution; the section is specified by the tracking regime. Such information directly reveals peer quality, despite the fact that a student's ability is not directly observable and that the grouping of students into different tracks is endogenous. Therefore, we are able to separate the roles of own ability and peer quality in the technology, a common identification concern in this literature.\nWe use the estimated model to conduct two policy evaluations. First, we quantify the effects of allowing ability tracking on the distribution of student achievement by comparing outcomes from the baseline model, where schools choose tracking regimes, with counterfactual outcomes where no schools are allowed to track students, i.e. class composition is equal across classrooms in a school. Over 95% of schools in our sample practice ability tracking under the baseline and therefore are affected by this policy. A tracking ban increases peer quality for low-ability students and decreases peer quality for high-ability students. In response, schools increase their effort overall, but parents react differently depending on their child's ability. The increase in the peer quality for low-ability students is effectively an increase in these households' endowments, causing their parents to reduce their provision of costly effort. Conversely, parents of high-ability students increase their effort because their children now have lower quality peers. Altogether, banning tracking increases the achievement of students with below-median prior scores by 4% of a standard deviation (sd) in outcome test score and reduces the achievement of students with above-median prior scores by 5% sd. We find the average treatment effect from banning tracking is very small, so the effects of tracking are mostly distributional in nature.\nIt is worth noting, however, that peer quality is estimated to be an important input in the production function: holding all other inputs at their average levels and increasing peer quality by one standard deviation (sd) above the average causes a 24% sd increase in the outcome test score. Underlying the small net effect are the behavioral responses of parents and schools. Indeed, if the effort adjustments by schools and parents in response to the ban on tracking were ignored, one would overstate the loss for students with above-median prior scores by 57%, and overstate the gain for students with below-median prior scores by over 100%. That is, the effect of banning tracking would appear much larger were we to hold school and parental effort constant at their levels under the status quo. Our work helps to cast light on the open question of why estimated peer effects are typically small, as reviewed by Sacerdote (2011) . It is exactly the fact that peer quality is an important input that induces substantial behavioral responses by schools and parents, which in turn mitigate the direct effect of peer quality.\nBecause policies that affect schools' tracking decisions will necessarily lead to increases of peer quality for some students and decreases for some other students, our second counterfactual experiment highlights the trade-offs involved in achieving academic policy goals. In the model, schools value both average achievement and the fraction of students testing above a proficiency standard, which policymakers may have control over. In this counterfactual, we search for region-specific proficiency standards that would maximize average student test scores in each Census region. Achievement-maximizing standards would be higher than their baseline levels in every region, but do not increase without bound because eventually the density of student ability decreases, reducing the gain in average achievement to increasing standards. Under these higher proficiency standards, schools would adjust their effort inputs and tracking regimes such that resources are moved away from lowability students toward high-ability students, leading to decreases in achievement for low-ability students and increases in achievement for high-ability students.\nThis paper contributes to and brings together two strands of studies on ability tracking: one measuring how tracking affects student achievement and one studying the determinants of tracking decisions. 5 We take a first step in the literature towards creating a comprehensive framework to understand tracking, by building and estimating a model where tracking regimes and track-specific inputs, parental effort, and student achievement are viewed as joint equilibrium outcomes. There is considerable heterogeneity in results from empirical work assessing the effect of ability tracking on both the level and distribution of achievement. Argys et al. (1996) find that tracking reduces the performance of low ability students, while Betts and Shkolnik (2000b) and Figlio and Page (2002) find no significant differences in outcomes for US high school students of the same ability level at tracked and untracked schools. Duflo et al. (2011) run an experiment in Kenya and find that students of all abilities gain from a tracking regime where students were assigned to high-and low-ability classrooms, relative to a control group where students were randomly assigned to the two classrooms. Gamoran (1992) finds that the effects of ability tracking on high school students vary across schools. The heterogeneous findings from these studies indicate that there is no one \"causal effect\" of ability tracking which generalizes to all contexts, and therefore highlight the importance of explicitly taking into account the fact that households differ within a school and that the distributions of households differ across schools, both of which are fundamental to our model and empirical analyses. Fruehwirth (2013) identifies peer achievement spillovers using the introduction of a student accountability policy as an instrument.\n7 She uses this instrumental variable to eliminate the problem of nonrandom assignment in identifying peer achievement spillovers, which is a valid approach as long as students are not reassigned in response to the policy. 8 Our paper complements her work. Unlike Fruehwirth (2013), we assume that a student's achievement does not depend directly on the effort choices by other students (households), hence abstracting from direct social interactions within a class.\n9 Instead, we model schools' decisions about student assignment and track-specific inputs in order to study the nonrandom assignment of students across classrooms, and how parents respond. While our work focuses on how peer groups are determined within a school, a different literature studies how households sort themselves into different schools. Epple et al. (2002) study how ability tracking by public schools may affect student sorting between private and public schools. They find that when public schools track 6 There is also a literature studying between-school tracking, e.g. Hanushek and Woessmann (2006) . 7 See Manski (1993) , Moffitt (2001) , and Brock and Durlauf (2001) for methodological contributions concerning the identification of peer effects and Betts and Shkolnik (2000a) for a review on empirical work in this respect.\n8 The author provides support for this assumption by showing that observable compositions of peer groups do not appear to change in response to student accountability. Assuming random assignment to classrooms within schools, Fruehwirth (2014) finds positive effects of peer parental education on student achievement.\n9 See Blume et al. (2011) for a comprehensive review of the social interactions literature.\nby ability, they may attract higher ability students who otherwise would have attended private schools. This is consistent with our finding that high-ability students benefit from tracking. Caucutt (2002) , Romano (1998), Ferreyra (2007) , Mehta (2013) , Nechyba (2000) develop equilibrium models to study sorting between schools and its effects on peer composition. 10 Walters (2014) studies the demand for charter schools. Our work complements this literature by taking a first step toward studying schools' tracking decisions, which determine class-level peer groups faced by households within a school, and emphasizing the interactions between a school and attendant households in the determination of student outcomes.

The joint distribution take the following form, the details of which are in Appendix A.1\nThis specification has three features worth commenting on. First, ability distributions are school-specific and discrete. This assumption allows us to tractably model unobserved student heterogeneity in a manner that allows ability distributions to substantially vary between schools, which is important to our understanding why schools make different tracking decisions. Second, given that the pre-determined student ability is itself an outcome from previous parental inputs, the latter being affected by parental types, the two unobserved characteristics of the households are inherently correlated with each other. We capture this correlation by assuming that the distribution of parental types depends not only on parental characteristics but also on student ability. Third, the noisy measure of student ability (previous test score) is assumed to be a sufficient statistic for ability, conditional on which the ability distribution does not depend on parental characteristics. We are not, however assuming that parental characteristics do not matter for ability, rather that the previous test scores summarize all the information.

First, the choice of tracking regimes in each school is constrained by both the number of classrooms and the size of each classroom (i.e., the fraction of students that can be accommodated in a classroom). Let K s be the number of classrooms in school s, we assume that the size of a particular track can only take values from 0, , ..., 1 . Schools with more classrooms have finer grids of M s . Second, the ability distribution within a track cannot be \"disjoint\" in the sense that a track cannot mix low-and high-ability students while excluding middleability students. Subject to these two constraints, M s contains all possible ways to allocate students across the K s classrooms.

The first involves more flexible test score production functions. For example, we have allowed for additional interaction terms between q and e s , as well as q and e p to allow for the the possibility that the effect of peer quality may vary with effort inputs. Following the discussion of non-linear peer effects in Sacerdote (2011), we also allow for an interaction effect between q and a. To entertain the possibility that teaching may be more or less effective in classes with widely-heterogeneous students, we have also included in the production function the dispersion of class ability, as measured by the coefficient of variation, and its interaction with e s . The second aspect is on the household side, where we have allowed for additional heterogeneity in the effectiveness of parental effort besides that in parental effort costs. Finally, on the school side, we have allowed for 1) a nested logit counterpart of equation (3) in school's regime choices, and 2) an additional payoff in the school's objective function that increases with the fraction of students achieving outstanding test scores.\nRemark 1 Our finding that the non-linear terms are not important in the technology does not contradict the literature documenting evidence of non-linear peer effects. In a reduced form of our model, student achievement is a highly non-linear function of inputs, in particular peer quality, as illustrated by Appendix C.\n19 The final choice of the detailed specification of the model is, of course, data-dependent. The more general models we have considered do not add much more complication to the estimation or the simulation. We view this as good news for future work that uses a different dataset because one can feasibly extend our current specification. 20 The conclusions from our counterfactual experiments are robust to the inclusion of these additional features (results available upon request)."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K).

For example, the average prior test score in schools with only one track is 53.4 with a CV of 0.14 and fewer than 45% of students below the median. In contrast, the average prior test score in schools with four tracks is 50.0 with a CV of 0.17 and more than 57% of students below the median. Tables 2-4 present summary statistics by the number of tracks in the school and the identity of a track. For example, entries in (Columns 7-8, Row 3) of a table refer to students who belong to the third track in a school are those with both parents (75% in the whole sample vs. 79% in the final sample) and/or collegeeducated parents (49% vs. 51%). Although it is comforting to see that the attrition is largely random, the slight non-randomness leads us to make some caveats, as discussed in Appendix D. Table 2 shows that students in higher ability tracks have both higher average outcome test scores and a higher probability of passing the regional proficiency cutoff. Comparing average student outcome scores and pass rates in schools with one track to those in other schools, they are similar to those of the middle-track students in schools with three or four tracks. That is, the average student allocated to the lower (higher) track in a multiple-track school has poorer (better) outcomes than an average student attending a single-track school. Table 3 shows average school effort by track. With the exception of Track 4 in schools with four tracks, the average school effort (expected hours of homework done by students per week) increases with track level, or track-specific average ability, in schools with more than one track. At the school level, the average effort level stays roughly constant with the number of tracks. Table 4 shows that parental effort shows the opposite pattern compared to school effort. Average parental effort (frequency of helping child with homework in reading) decreases with student ability or track level. For example, in schools with three tracks, while parents of low-track students on average help their children 2.6 times per week, parents of high-track students do so only 2.1 times. Table 5 summarizes parental effort and student outcomes by household characteristics. Compared to their counterpart, parents without college education, single parents and parents with lower-prior-achievement children exert more parental effort. Nevertheless, average student outcome test scores are lower in these households. 4 Estimation and Identification"}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "We estimate the model using maximum likelihood, where parameter estimates maximize the probability of observing the joint endogenous outcomes, given the observed distributions of household characteristics across schools.

Separating these channels has been the focus of much empirical work.\n32 The focus of this paper is to understand the interrelated nature of school tracking decisions, track input choices, and parental effort choices, not to push the frontier of identification of social interactions models. However, it does take these inferential problems seriously and addresses them by utilizing two arguments. First, similar to other work (Caucutt (2002) , Epple and Romano (1998) , Epple et al. (2002) ), the mechanism through which tracking operates is through peer quality. Although peer quality and one's own ability depend on the history of inputs, they are pre-determined at the beginning of the game. Therefore, as in this other work, the \"reflection problem\" of separating endogenous effects from exogenous contextual effects is not relevant here. 33 Although endogenous social interactions do not pose an identification problem in our context, we must address the problem of separating exogenous contextual effects, which operate through unobserved peer quality, and correlated effects. In our context, this is the same as accounting for selection into peer groups (Moffitt (2001) ). Intuitively, if we do not account for the correlation between own ability and peer quality when students are tracked, what looks like the effect of peers may instead be correlated unobservables (i.e. own ability and peer quality are correlated), creating an inferential problem. To address this second concern, we exploit two key pieces of information available in the ECLS-K survey. The first is student prior test scores, assumed to be sufficient statistics of their ability. The distribution of student test scores in each school therefore maps into the school-specific ability distribution. The second piece of information comes from teacher surveys, which directly classify each student's track quality as high, middle or low. This additional information, available for multiple classes, allows us to essentially \"observe\" two key components of model. 33 This also means we can estimate a linear-in-means technology without having to exploit nonlinearities in peer effects, a strategy identified by Blume et al. (2006) . 34 Assuming we observe a representative sample of classes per school.\nschool-specific ability distribution; the section is specified by the tracking regime. Such information directly reveals peer quality, despite the fact that a student's ability is not directly observable and that the grouping of students into different tracks is endogenous. Therefore, we are able to separate the roles of own ability and peer quality in the technology, a common identification concern in this literature."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Parameters", "text": "In this section, we present estimates of key parameters. Other parameter estimates can be found in Appendix B. Table 6 presents the production technology parameter estimates, where the coefficient of student's own ability has been set to one. We find that school effort and parental effort complement each other, while the interaction between a student's own ability and school effort is (insignificantly) negative. To understand the magnitudes of parameters in Table 6 , we calculate the outcome test scores according to the estimated production function by increasing one input at a time while keeping other inputs at model averages. 35 The marginal effect of increasing ability by one standard deviation (sd) above the model average causes a 74% sd increase in the outcome test score. Increasing peer quality by one sd causes a 24% sd increase in the outcome test score. Increasing school effort by one sd causes a 2% sd increase in the outcome test score; while increasing parental effort by one sd increases the outcome test score by 44% sd. Table 7 presents estimates of school- The second row shows that the cost of school effort is convex in effort levels. 37 The last three rows show that the cost of tracking regimes is nonlinear in the number of tracks. The most costly tracking regimes are those with four tracks (the highest possible number), followed by those with only one track (the cost of which normalized to zero). Without further information, our model is unable to distinguish between various components of the cost associated with different tracking regimes. However, we think these estimates are not unreasonable. On the one hand, increasing the number of tracks may involve developing more types of curricula as well as incur higher resistance from parents. On the other hand, pooling all students into one track may make the classroom too heterogeneous and thus difficult for the teacher to handle. If these competing costs are both convex in the number of tracks, one would expect the total cost to be higher for the one-and four-track cases. Table   Table 7 0.30 0.52 regime cost, 4 tracks 8 shows the parameters governing parental effort cost and the probability of being a high-cost parent. We find that the cost of parental effort is convex. The linear typespecific cost term is 10% higher for the high-cost type than for the low-cost type. If both types exert the same level (sample average) of parental effort, the high-cost type incur a 3% higher cost than the low-cost type. The last four rows show the relationship between household characteristics with parental cost types. There is a strong relationship between child ability and the probability that the parent is a high-cost type. Higher-educated parents also tend to have higher effort cost. We do 36 See, for example, Koretz and Barron (1998), Linn (2000) , Klein et al. (2000) , Carnoy and Loeb (2002) , Hanushek and Raymond (2005) , Jacob (2005) , Wong et al.

Around 39% of all parents are of the high cost type. This fraction is higher among college-educated parents (44.8%) and among single parents (43.1%). On average, children of low-cost parents have lower prior test scores with a mean of 47.7 and a sd of 9, compared to those of high-cost parents (mean of 57.5 and sd of 6.9). This is consistent with the data in Table 5 , where parents without college education and parents of children with lower prior achievement exert more parental effort, yet average student outcome test scores are lower in these households.

The first two columns show that the model closely matches the distribution of tracking regimes across all schools. The next two columns show the fit for schools with lower spread of prior test scores, where a school is called a low-spread school if it has a coefficient of variation (CV) of prior scores below the median CV. The model slightly overpredicts the fraction of two-track schools and underpredicts that of three-track schools. The next two columns focus on schools with higher-achieving students. In particular, we rank schools by the fraction of lower-prior-score (below median score) students from high to low: the higher the ranking of a school, the higher fraction of its students are of low initial achievement. We report the tracking regime distribution among schools that are ranked below the median in this ranking, i.e., schools with relatively better students. Overall, the model captures the pattern that schools with less variation and/or higher prior test scores are more likely to have only one track and less likely to have four tracks.

The right panel splits the distribution by parental education and by single-parenthood. As seen, the model-predicted score distributions match well with the ones in the data. Table 12 shows the model fit for school effort. Compared to the data, the model predicts a flatter profile for school effort across tracks. Table  13 shows the model fit for mean parental effort: the model matches the fact that parent effort decreases with track level, although the gradient is over-predicted in the four-track case (last two columns). Finally, Table 14 shows that the model fits well the level of parental effort and outcome scores by household characteristics. Parents with less education, single parents, and students with lower prior score all have higher parent effort levels and lower outcome test scores.

Over 95% of the simulated schools practice ability tracking to some degree under the baseline, hence are affected by this counterfactual and experience an exogenously imposed change in peer quality within classrooms.\nThe first two panels in the top row of Figure 2 show average results for outcome test scores and pass rates, by decile of prior test score. The effects of a tracking ban are positive for students with lower prior test scores and negative for those with higher prior test scores, as measured in both the level of the final test scores and the pass rates. In particular, students with below-median prior scores gain 3.6% sd when ability tracking is banned, while those with above-median prior scores lose 5% sd when tracking is banned.\n41 Consistent with the first two panels, the third panel shows that the fraction of students who gain from a tracking ban declines with prior test scores. 42 Underlying the changes in student outcomes are the changes in the inputs, i.e., peer quality, school effort and parental effort, which are plotted in the bottom three panels of Figure 2 , by decile of prior test scores. The tracking ban places all students in a school in one track, which means that lower ability students are on average placed with better students, and are made better off through the technology, ceteris paribus. The opposite holds for higher ability students. However, that is not the entire story. Both school effort and parental effort adjust to the change in peer composition imposed by this policy. Without the freedom to optimize 40 Results from our counterfactual experiments are subject to the caveat that household distribution across schools are fixed. Incorporating households' school choices into our framework is an important extension we leave for the future work.\n41 The ATE of banning tracking over all students is -0.04 points, or about -0.4% sd in test scores. Our result that tracking (in the short run) hurts lower-ability students and benefits higher-ability students is consistent with findings from some previous studies, e.g. Betts and Shkolnik (2000b) and Hoffer (1992) .\n42 There are possible scenarios where the omission of cross-school sorting might lead us to overpredict the effect on achievement of a ban on tracking. For example, given that this policy lowers peer quality for high-ability students in schools that used to track students in the baseline, it is possible that some of these households may re-sort themselves to schools with more homogeneous peers. Decile of prior score ATE by outcome, in sd over tracking regimes, schools that used to track students can only optimize over their effort inputs. As there is only one track, a school can only choose one effort level for all students. On average, schools increase their effort for students in all deciles (the second panel on the bottom). This change is most obvious for students with very high or very low prior test scores, who are more likely to have been tracked under the baseline. Unlike schools, which choose one effort level for all students in one track, parents can always adjust their effort levels for their own children. Indeed, the last panel shows that changes in parental effort are not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different across students with different prior test scores. Average parental effort decreases for students below the median and increases for those above the median. In particular, parents of students in the highest decile increase their inputs by the largest amount when tracking is banned, by about 2% sd. Figure 2 highlights the trade-offs a school faces when choosing a tracking regime. Improving peer quality in one track necessarily involves reducing it in another, which will in turn lead to changes in parental effort. When low-ability students are grouped with higher-ability students, peer quality increases (decreases) for students with low (high) ability. For parents with low-ability students, who have been exerting much higher effort than those with high-ability students (Table 14) , the exogenous increase in peer quality provides strong incentives for them to reduce their own effort. For parents with high-ability students, the exogenous decrease in peer quality pushes them to increase their own effort as a remedy. However, given the concavity of the parents' net payoff with respect to their own effort, the reduction in effort by the parents of low ability children is larger than the increase in effort by the parents of high ability children, especially among parents with very low-achieving children. To curb the reduction in parental effort among low-achieving households and encourage more effort in high-achieving households, the school increases its own effort, utilizing the fact that school effort and parental efforts are complementary to each other. Depending on the different sets of households they face, schools differ in how much effort they need to exert and how their students perform when they do not track versus when they track. These differences drive schools' different tracking decisions."}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Accounting for Behavioral Changes: Effort Inputs", "text": "The test score technology plays an important role in evaluating the effect of tracking on student outcomes, which may partly explain why much of the literature studying tracking and peer quality focuses on estimating it. This might prompt one to ask whether estimates of parameters governing the technology alone would adequately characterize outcomes for students were tracking banned. To illustrate the value of estimating an equilibrium model where schools and parents may respond to changes in track peer quality, we contrast the ATE of banning tracking from our model prediction with the ATE ignoring endogenous effort responses. Decile of prior score ATE lower-achieving students receive more inputs from the school, in terms of both peer quality and school effort. In response, parents of these students reduce their own effort. Failing to take into account this reduction drastically overstates the ATE of banning tracking for these students. The brown line lies far above the red line for students with the lower prior scores, especially those at the end of the distribution. The opposite is true for students with higher prior scores, whose parents increase their provision of costly effort in response to the lower peer quality. The black (dotted-dashed) line is the ATE for test scores ignoring both school and parent effort adjustments, i.e. Y (a, q * CF , e s * , e p * ) \u2212 Y (a, q * , e s * , e p * ).

This is especially true in the case of educational policies that may affect ability tracking, which has qualitatively different effects on students of varying ability levels. This is because changing peer quality for some students necessarily involves changing peer quality for some other students, which is accompanied by adjustment in the effort choices by the school and by parents. By incorporating tracking regimes, school effort, and parental effort inputs into one framework, our work lends itself to a better understanding of the trade-offs educational policies can generate. Our second counterfactual experiment highlights this point by examining how changes in proficiency standards would affect the distribution of student achievement. Because schools care about the fraction of students above the proficiency standard, changes in these standards can guide the new equilibrium toward certain policy goals. 43 As an illustration, we search for region-specific proficiency standards that maximize the region-specific averages of student test scores."}, {"section_title": "44", "text": "Figure 4 places proficiency standards in relation to the distribution of baseline outcome test scores, by region, where the left panel (4(a)) shows the density and the right panel (4(b)) shows the CDF. Each panel overlays the distribution of baseline outcome scores with the baseline proficiency standards (blue dotted line). Loosely speaking, the ranking of the regional distributions of student baseline achievement from high to low (in the sense of first order stochastic dominance) is the Northeast, the Midwest, the West, and lastly the South. This ranking lines up with that of regional proficiency standards, with the Northeast having the highest standard and the South having the lowest. In all four regions, the baseline (data) standard is approximately located at the 30th percentile of the regional distribution of the outcome scores.\nThe regional standards that maximize region-specific average achievement are the red solid lines in Figure 4 , which are higher in all four regions than the baseline standards. When standards are lower (as in the baseline), schools have the incentive to improve outcomes near the lower end of the distribution, which would sacrifice a much larger measure of students near the middle and top of the distribution of baseline scores. The same argument applies for the case if standards are too high. The new standards maximize the average performance by moving schools' attention away from the low-performing students toward a location that rewards schools for improving mean test scores. In fact, the new standards are located at around the median of each region's baseline distribution of test scores, which is also where the density of outcome scores is highest, as seen in Figure 4 (a). Figure 5 (a) summarizes the ATE on outcome scores by region due to the change in standards. Setting standards to maximize average achievement has the biggest ATE in the South, followed by the West, the Midwest and finally the Northeast, which is in the reverse order as the baseline regional proficiency standards. Intuitively, the ATE is increasing in the difference between the baseline and achievement-maximizing standards. Figure 5 (b) plots the ATE on the outcome score and inputs (school effort, peer quality, and parental effort) by baseline score and region. The top panel shows that in all four regions, the ATE on outcome test scores increases with student baseline outcome scores. In fact, the ATE is negative for students with low baseline scores and positive for students with high baseline scores. Underlying the pattern of the ATE on outcome test scores is schools' redistribution of their inputs away from low-achieving students toward high-achieving students, as shown in the second and third panels of Figure 5 (b). Schools decrease (increase) their effort inputs for students with lower (higher) baseline scores. In addition, schools also change their tracking regimes such that peer quality decreases (increases) for low-achieving (highachieving) students. Finally, the bottom panel shows that the ATE on parental effort moves in the opposite direction to school inputs, which mitigates but does not reverse the effects of school input adjustment on student outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We have developed and estimated a model of ability tracking, in which a school's tracking regime, track-specific inputs, parental effort and student achievement are joint equilibrium outcomes. The estimated model has been shown to fit the data well. Using the estimated model, we have shown that the effects of tracking are hetero-geneous across students with different prior test scores. In response to the exogenous changes in peer composition under a ban on tracking, schools on average increase their effort inputs for all students. Parents with low-ability students decrease their effort, while those with high-ability students increase theirs. As a result, a ban on tracking would increase the performance for students with below-median prior scores by 3.6% sd, while decrease that for those with above-median prior scores by 5% sd. These seemingly-small effects confound the change in peer quality and that in effort inputs, both of which have significant impacts on achievement. In fact, ignoring endogenous effort changes would cause one to overstate the gains from banning tracking by over 100% for students with below median prior scores, and overstate the loss by 57% for students with above median prior scores.
