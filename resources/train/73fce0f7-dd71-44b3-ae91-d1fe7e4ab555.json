[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Objective: In 2012, North Dakota enacted a comprehensive statewide law prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places. Disparities in tobacco control exist in rural areas. This study's objective was to determine the extent to which the passage of a comprehensive, statewide, smoke-free law in a predominantly rural state influenced tobacco smoke pollution in rural and nonrural venues. Design and Sample: A longitudinal cohort design study comparing the levels of tobacco smoke pollution before and after passage of the statewide smoke-free law was conducted in 64 restaurants and bars statewide in North Dakota. Measures: Particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 lm (a valid atmospheric marker of tobacco smoke pollution) was assessed. Results: A significant 83% reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred after passage of the law. Significant reductions in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred in each of the rural categories; however, no difference by rurality was noted in the analysis after passage of the law, in contrast to the study before passage. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the largest, single, rural postlaw study globally. A comprehensive statewide smoke-free law implemented in North Dakota dramatically decreased the level of tobacco smoke pollution in bars and restaurants."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke pollution, and the only method that fully protects people is the prohibition of smoking in all indoor areas (U. From 2005 to December 2012, the North Dakota Century Code required workplaces and public places to be smoke free, but exempted bars and separately enclosed \"co-located\" bar areas within hotels, bowling centers, and restaurants (\"Chapter 23-12: Public Health, Miscellaneous Provisions,\" 2012) . Exemptions for bars were removed when the 2012 law was enacted, and electronic cigarettes were added to the prohibition. Twenty-four of the 39 states with smoke-free regulations have passed comprehensive statewide laws similar to the North Dakota law prohibiting smoking in the indoor areas of worksites, restaurants, and bars (ANRF, 2015) .\nThe primary impetus for the global increase in smoke-free regulations is the scientific evidence of the harmful health outcomes caused by tobacco smoke pollution (Institute of Medicine, 2010; USDHHS, 2006 USDHHS, , 2015 WHO, 2011) . Disparities in tobacco use and control exist for rural populations (American Lung Association, 2012; Mitchell, Kneipp, & Giscombe, 2016; Pleis, Ward, & Lucas, 2010) . Smoking prevalence is higher outside of metropolitan statistical areas, with rural populations significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes (USDHHS, 2011; Vander Weg, Cunningham, Howren, & Cai, 2011) . Rural areas have fewer cessation resources and are less likely to have workplace polices restricting smoking (Mitchell et al., 2016; Vander Weg et al., 2011) . North Dakota's vast rural areas place many of its citizens at risk for the harms of tobacco.\nAn examination of the literature on studies measuring indoor tobacco smoke pollution conducted in rural areas and studies using randomselection sampling methods was included in the prelaw phase of this study. The examination revealed nine studies conducted in rural communities (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013; Buettner-Schmidt, Lobo, Travers, & Boursaw, 2015) . However, the assessment of air quality in rural areas was not stated as the purpose of the studies, nor was the sample frame discussed in terms of rurality, and all studies used convenience samples. Since then, an additional article on the levels of tobacco smoke in rural hospitality venues has been published; out of 586 purposively chosen venues, that study identified approximately 71 venues that were assessed before and after passage of local smoke-free laws (Lee et al., 2015) . The researchers reported no difference in tobacco smoke pollution by rural or urban status.\nInitially, the importance of conducting a study of smoke-free environments in rural areas became evident during the first author's 25 years of experience in working in tobacco control that included rural areas. During that experience, resistance to smoke-free laws in rural areas was frequently verbalized by rural residents and the policymakers representing them. For example, one legislator stated that if a community had only one restaurant and it was required to be smoke-free, that would leave a smoker with nowhere to eat and smoke, and the restaurant would likely close due to decreased business. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015) , Health Equity in Tobacco Prevention and Control, continues to identify inequities in rural areas related, in part, to the tobacco industry's targeting of rural populations and the reluctance of state and local government to implement smoke-free laws. The report recommends collecting data on secondhand smoke exposure in rural populations. An objective of the current postlaw study was to determine the extent to which the passage of a comprehensive statewide smoke-free law in a predominantly rural state influenced tobacco smoke pollution in hospitality venues (bars and restaurants).\nThe prelaw phase of the study was conducted before the new law was enacted and was the first published statewide study on tobacco smoke pollution in hospitality venues; to our knowledge, it represented the only study known globally on indoor smoking pollution in rural areas using random sampling. This study showed an association between rurality and tobacco smoke pollution; as rurality increased, so did the levels of tobacco smoke pollution. It served as a comparison for the postlaw study (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013; BuettnerSchmidt et al., 2015) . In this postlaw study, tobacco smoke pollution levels were assessed after passage of the law, and investigation into factors that influenced the quantity of indoor tobacco smoke pollution in North Dakota's hospitality venues was continued. This postlaw study was the first statewide study on tobacco smoke pollution levels in hospitality venues with a planned goal of comparing rural and nonrural venues using a longitudinal design to measure the impact of a comprehensive statewide smoke-free law."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design and sample", "text": "This was a longitudinal cohort design study with two time periods. Data collection before passage of the state law is identified as the prelaw phase, and data collection after passage of the law is identified as the postlaw phase. Randomly sampled restaurants and bars in North Dakota, except those located within American Indian reservations, formed the cohort for this study. Because human participants were not involved in the study, institutional review board approval was not necessary.\nSampling for the prelaw phase was described previously (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013; BuettnerSchmidt et al., 2015) . Briefly, restaurant and bar lists were obtained and verified by governmental agencies. Venues on tribal land, private clubs or seasonal venues, catering or drive-up-only venues, national fast food chains, and school or residential facilities were excluded. The randomization of venues and sample size was based on power analysis and described previously.\nBecause some venues were out of business or we were unable to obtain tobacco smoke pollution levels, 135 of the 146 randomly chosen venues were included in the prelaw analysis, for a \"participation rate\" of 92.5%. Sixteen venues that were co-located bars and restaurants were included in the prelaw phase. At that time, smoking was allowed in the bars but not the restaurants if the bar was separately enclosed. Both the restaurant and bar were sampled, for a total of 32 such venues. In the prelaw phase, venues were assessed for tobacco smoke pollution between May 11, 2012 , and July 13, 2012 (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013 Buettner-Schmidt et al., 2015) .\nInclusion criteria for the postlaw phase included measures of tobacco smoke pollution, which are described in detail in the Measures section. Specifically, because of financial and time constraints, only prelaw phase venues that were colocated (n = 23) and those venues assessed in the prelaw phase with average levels of particulate matter (PM) <2.5 lm (PM 2.5 ) above the Moderate Air Quality Index (AQI) category of \u226535.5 lg/m 3 (n = 63) were included in the postlaw phase (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2013, n.d.-b) . Because 16 of the co-located venues also had PM 2.5 \u226535.5 lg/m 3 , a total of 70 venues were included in postlaw phase. Co-located venues were chosen because the bars within these venues were no longer able to allow smoking under the new law (\"Chapter 23-12: Public Health, Miscellaneous Provisions,\" 2012). In the postlaw phase, venues were assessed for tobacco smoke pollution between March 15, 2013, and May 4, 2013. Of the total sample of 70 venues, one was closed for remodeling, one was determined to be unsafe for data collectors to enter, one was misclassified in the prelaw phase, and three were considered contaminated because of a lit candle (n = 1), a fog machine on the dance floor (n = 1), and a fireplace (n = 1). Thus, 64 venues were included for analysis in the postlaw phase. All data were collected on the required days and times per the study protocol, except in one co-located restaurant, as in the prelaw phase.\nRoswell Park Cancer Institute data collection protocols were modified slightly and used for data collection for both phases and were described extensively previously (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013; Travers, 2010) . Of note, SidePak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitors were used to collect PM 2.5 levels (TSI Group, Shoreview, MN, USA). Data collection was completed discreetly without knowledge of the venues' owners or patrons by placing the SidePaks into a purse-like bag, with just a few inches of an air-intake tubing outside of the bag. The room dimensions were obtained using a sonic measurement device. Data collectors remained within the venue for a minimum of 30 min, per accepted published protocol (Travers, 2010) . Data were collected during perceived typical peak patronage times, with restaurant data collected any day from 11:30 a.m. "}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Burning cigarettes emit PM in large amounts (Travers, 2010) . PM is made up of liquid droplets and small particles suspended in the air, some of which can be toxic and result in detrimental health consequences when breathed into the lung (Pope & Dockery, 2006; Travers, 2010) . Tobacco smoke contains PM, most of which has a median aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 lm, and PM 2.5 is the standard size used to measure tobacco smoke pollution (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2009; Klepeis, Apte, Gundel, Sextro, & Nazaroff, 2003; Klepeis, Ott, & Switzer, 2007; Lee et al., 2011) . A calibration factor of 0.32, appropriate for tobacco smoke, was applied to all PM 2.5 data from the SidePak (Hyland, Travers, Dresler, Higbee, & Cummings, 2008; Klepeis et al., 2003 Klepeis et al., , 2007 . The first and last minutes of SidePak data in each 168\nPublic Health Nursing Volume 34 Number 2 March/April 2017 location were removed to avoid including data from outdoors or entrances, and the remaining data points were averaged to determine the mean PM 2.5 concentration in each location. Although there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke pollution and because there is not an acceptable standard for PM 2.5 for indoor air, the EPA's AQI for outdoor air is used to provide context for the quantities of PM 2.5 and their harm (EPA, 2013, n.d.-b; USDHHS, 2006 USDHHS, , 2015 . The EPA sets the PM 2.5 24-hr and annual standards for outdoor air (EPA, 2013, n.d.-b) . The AQI is the EPA's notification system designed to inform the public about the cleanliness of the air and to provide health warnings about dangerous pollution levels. It is divided into six categories based on PM 2.5 levels from 0 to 500 lg/m 3 : good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous. A significant harm level was identified in 2009 for PM 2.5 levels \u2265500 lg/m 3 (EPA, 2009a,b) . For this study, we divided the hazardous category into two categories: hazardous and very hazardous. The 2012 AQI categories were used, along with the 2009 significant harm level and the authors' modifications to the hazardous category (EPA, 2009a (EPA, ,b, 2013 , to interpret the data (Table 1 ; Buettner-Schmidt et al., 2015) .\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (2013) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs), a classification system that identifies counties according to the degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metropolitan area, was used to classify the venue's degree of rurality. In the prelaw phase, the definition of rurality was based on the 2003 RUCCs (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2013). In the postlaw phase, the 2013 RUCCs were used (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2013) . This altered the classification in two counties. However, in both phases, completely rural was defined as counties with a RUCC of 8-9; semi-rural/urban was defined as counties with a code of 4-7; and nonrural was defined as counties with a code of 1-3. Oliver County changed from RUCC 9 for the prelaw phase to RUCC 3 for the postlaw phase based on commuting patterns between Oliver County and the Bismarck, North Dakota, Metropolitan Statistical Area. In addition, with the rapid population changes occurring in Williams County due to intense oil exploration, that county was reclassified as RUCC 5 for the postlaw phase, but this did not change its classification as semi-rural/urban for analysis in both studies.\nAnalytic strategy SPSS and Stata were used for data analysis, which included assessment of missing data and outliers. Descriptive statistics appropriate to both continuous and categorical variables were calculated, and because of strong positive skewness in PM 2.5 levels and relatively small sample sizes in some subgroups, nonparametric inferential statistical techniques were used. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine changes in PM 2.5 levels over time, and the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test associations between PM 2.5 levels and the categorical variables of venue type (restaurant or bar) and rurality (rural, semi-rural/ urban, or nonrural), respectively. Consistent with the use of nonparametric statistics, median values for PM 2.5 levels were calculated alongside these statistical tests. Reported median values also provide an alternative measure of center for positively skewed PM 2.5 levels with large, outlying maximum values.\nBecause restaurants, unlike bars, were required to be smoke-free statewide in the prelaw phase, a difference-in-difference analysis was also conducted using a Mann-Whitney test to assess whether prepost differences in PM 2.5 levels differed systematically between restaurants and bars. Scatterplots between starting time of measurement and PM 2.5 levels were used alongside calculations of Spearman's q to screen for the possibility of confounding relationships between time of measurement and tobacco smoke pollution levels. Effect sizes for Mann-Whitney tests were calculated using the formula r \u00bc z ffiffiffi N p , and effect sizes for Wilcoxon signedrank tests were calculated using the formula r \u00bc z ffiffiffiffiffi 2N p . In both cases, the standard cutoffs in magnitude for small, medium, and large effects of .1, .3, and .5, respectively, were used for interpretation. For all statistical tests, the threshold for statistical significance was set at a = .05."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Overall tobacco smoke pollution levels Table 2 compares the average PM 2.5 levels for all prelaw venues with the same venues assessed in the postlaw phase. As is shown in Figure 1 , average PM 2.5 levels decreased by 83% from the prelaw to the postlaw phases across all venues. With median PM 2.5 levels of 113.5 lg/m 3 and 7.6 lg/m 3 , respectively, analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant reduction (T = 67, z = \u00c06.51, p < .001), with a large effect size (r = \u00c0.58). In the postlaw phase, only two venues had indoor observed smoking. Importantly, although significant reductions in the levels of tobacco smoke pollution occurred, some venues continued to have high levels of tobacco smoke pollution, as displayed in the postlaw maximum (Max PM 2.5 ) column of Table 2 . Scatterplots of PM 2.5 levels with the starting time of measurement in both the prelaw and postlaw phases revealed no systematic associations, consistent with a small and not statistically significant value of Spearman's q = .16 in the prelaw phase and a very small and not statistically significant value of Spearman's q = .05 in the postlaw phase."}, {"section_title": "Tobacco smoke pollution levels by venue type (restaurants or bars)", "text": "Because one of the goals of the new law was to improve public health by prohibiting smoking in bars, it is noteworthy that for bars alone (n = 51), an 88% average reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred after implementation of the law (Table 2 and Figure 1) . With a median PM 2.5 level of 137.0 lg/m 3 prelaw versus 6.7 lg/m 3 postlaw, a significant decrease in tobacco smoke pollution levels was shown, using the Wilcoxon signed-ranked test (T = 10, z = \u00c06.12, p < .001), with a large effect size (r = \u00c0.61). Although the restaurants that were included in the postlaw phase had PM 2.5 levels \u226535.5 lg/m 3 and were required to be smoke-free prelaw, they also experienced a 27% reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels postlaw (Table 2 and Consistent with these results, the difference-indifference analysis showed a significantly greater (U = 57.0, z = \u00c04.58, p < .001) decrease in tobacco smoke pollution levels in bars than in restaurants, with a large effect size (r = \u00c0.57). When analyzing only the postlaw phase venues, there was no statistically significant (U = 302.0, z = \u00c00.48, p = .628) difference in tobacco smoke pollution levels between restaurants and bars.\nTobacco smoke pollution levels by rurality Table 2 compares PM 2.5 levels by rurality before and after implementation of the new law. Tobacco smoke pollution levels were reduced from prelaw to postlaw for each of the rurality categories: a 95% average reduction for venues within nonrural or metropolitan counties, a 74% average reduction for venues in semi-rural/urban counties, and an 82% average reduction in venues in rural counties (Figure 2) . Analysis of PM 2.5 levels by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for all venues showed significant Note Avg = average; PM 2.5 = particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 lm; AQI = Air Quality Index; max = maximum; RUCC = rural-urban continuum code; RUCC 1-3 = nonrural; RUCC 4-7 = semirural/urban; RUCC 8-9 = rural. When analyzing only the postlaw phase venues using the Kruskal-Wallis test, there was no significant difference between tobacco smoke pollution and the three categories of rurality when including all venues, v 2 (2) = 3.17, p = .204, or when analyzing only bars, v 2 (2) = 1.15, p = .564. In the prelaw phase, tobacco smoke pollution showed a significant increase from nonrural to the combined semirural/urban and rural counties. In the postlaw phase, a similar comparison of nonrural counties with the combined semi-rural/urban and rural counties using the Mann-Whitney test revealed no significant difference (U = 223.5, z = \u00c01.21, p = .226), with a small effect size (r = \u00c0.15)."}, {"section_title": "National AQI standards", "text": "After implementation of the comprehensive law, the AQI color code improved for all bars and restaurants, based on average PM 2.5 levels. Overall, bars changed from the very unhealthy category to the moderate category and restaurants changed from the unhealthy to the unhealthy for sensitive groups category.

Significant reductions in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred from the prelaw to the postlaw phases in both bars and restaurants. Similarly, tobacco smoke pollution levels for each of the rurality categories also were significantly reduced from prelaw to postlaw. These reductions occurred relatively quickly. The state law was implemented December 6, 2012, and in the postlaw phase, venues were assessed approximately 3-5 months later, between March 15, 2013, and May 4, 2013. In the postlaw phase, there was no significant difference by rurality.\nAlthough a significant 83% average reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred in hospitality venues after implementation of North Dakota's statewide smoke-free law, some venues continued to have high levels of tobacco smoke pollution. The continued presence of tobacco smoke pollution could be related to smoking in some venues, perhaps indicating a need for increased enforcement of the law. One of the goals of the new law was to improve public health by prohibiting smoking in bars, and a significant 88% average reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels occurred. Although restaurants were required to be smoke-free prelaw, those included in this phase also experienced a significant 27% average reduction in tobacco smoke pollution levels. Some tobacco smoke pollution still occurred in restaurants, which may be due to tobacco use prior to the data collection or to smoke drifting indoors from outside through open doors, windows, or ventilation systems. Tobacco smoke pollution levels did not vary by rurality, supporting and strengthening the evidence that rurality does not affect tobacco smoke pollution levels in hospitality venues.\nAnalysis of tobacco smoke pollution levels from prelaw to postlaw overall showed significant reductions in each of the rural categories, with large effect sizes. Prelaw, significant increases in tobacco smoke pollution from nonrural to the combined semi-rural/urban and rural counties occurred; this was no longer true postlaw (Buettner-Schmidt, 2013; Buettner-Schmidt et al., 2015) . Caution in interpreting this finding is needed because of changes in the sampling frame between studies. Also, it is important to remember that the current tobacco smoke levels are not yet \"Good\" in all areas.\nLimitations of the prelaw phase were discussed previously (Buettner-Schmidt et al., 2015) . In the current postlaw phase, categorization according to the North American Industry Classification System or tax data was not available to classify venues. Extensive exclusion criteria were needed to narrow the sample appropriately. Assumptions were made about what the busiest times for collecting data would be. Generalizability may be limited to restaurants and bars in North Dakota and to other similar geographic areas. Restricting the postlaw sample to only those venues with PM 2.5 \u226535 because of time and financial constraints is a limitation.\nThis study was the postlaw phase of the first statewide study to identify the effects of a comprehensive statewide law banning smoking in hospitality venues. As the largest, single, rural postlaw study known globally, it makes important contributions to the science of tobacco control. After implementation of the law, tobacco smoke pollution in bars and restaurants decreased significantly over a relatively brief time span. Some venues continued to have high levels of tobacco smoke pollution, perhaps indicating a need for increased enforcement of the law.\nPublic health nurses are community leaders and have responsibility for the core public health functions of assessment, assurance, and policy development at the individual, community, and systems levels. Practice implications of this study include the need for ongoing education about the new law, ongoing assessment of compliance with the law, and assurance of enforcement of the law at all venues. This may be accomplished through collaboration with the appropriate systems, including law enforcement officials, direct community education to responsible parties at venues required to be smoke-free, and broad-reaching media campaigns to alert to the public to expect smoke-free venues and to report noncompliance.\nWith only 24 states having comprehensive smoke-free laws, policy development implications of this study for public health nurses are vast.\nWithout comprehensive laws in place, entire populations, whether at workplaces or in public places, continue to be exposed to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke pollution, young people continue to be exposed to smoking as a norm, and tobacco use rates may not decrease as rapidly. Public health nurses need to continue to effectively lead and advocate for the development of comprehensive statewide smoke-free laws through surveillance, community organizing, coalition development, collaboration, and media and social advocacy. Indeed, the first author, Buettner-Schmidt, and several other public health nurses were instrumental in development and advocacy during North Dakota's gradual progression from multiple local smoke-free laws to a limited statewide smoke-free law to the current comprehensive statewide smoke-free law (Rosenbaum, Barnes, & Glantz, 2012; Welle, Ibrahim, & Glantz, 2004) .\nAlthough this study focuses on smoke-free legislation, the public health successes observed here and with other evidenced-based tobacco control strategies, such as tobacco taxes, reinforce the importance of policy advocacy for public health nurses interested in pursuing \"endgame\" strategies. Endgame strategies seek to end the tobacco epidemic rather than \"control\" it. Notable endgame polices currently being discussed in the literature include regulating nicotine levels to make cigarettes non-addictive or less addictive, redesigning the cigarette to make it less appealing, banning sale of combustible tobacco, considering state takeover of tobacco companies, instituting price caps for cigarettes, and integrating various strategies concurrently (McDaniel, Smith, & Malone, 2016 ). An additional implication is related to nursing education. Ensuring that undergraduate baccalaureatelevel nursing education includes an introduction to policy development, implementation, and enforcement could increase public health nurses' competencies and confidence in the policy arena. At the graduate level, requiring nursing students to participate in the policy-making process could increase political connections, easing the transition to active political participation.\nIn this study, the comprehensive smoke-free law that was adopted at the state level effectively eliminated a health disparity experienced in rural areas. This signifies that although addressing disparities frequently requires targeting or tailoring an intervention to a specific population, it does not always appear to be necessary when comprehensive smoke-free laws are enacted at the state level. In this study, without targeting or tailoring of the intervention to rural populations and rural areas, the residents of the rural areas benefited from the law and benefited to such an extent that they no longer experienced worse health environments than their nonrural counterparts did. Widely adopted \"universal\" evidenced-based approaches can, indeed, be effective in improving health and eliminating disparities to the extent they are effectively universal and universally adopted and enforced."}]
