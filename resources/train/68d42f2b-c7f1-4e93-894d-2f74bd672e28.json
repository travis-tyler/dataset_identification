We discuss the potential COUs for each biomarker."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Worldwide, approximately 50 million people are living with dementia, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprising 60-70% of cases [391] . AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and behavioural disturbances and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed by tau fibrils, together with degeneration of neurons and their synapses, glial activation, and neuroinflammation [37, 149, 314] . The incidence of AD increases with age, and the prevalence is growing as a result of the ageing of the population [6] . To date, no disease-modifying therapy (DMT) has been successful [18] . This lack of success may be partly explained by AD having a complex aetiology and considerable heterogeneity in its pathophysiology, and by limitations in past clinical trial designs, which have generally enrolled participants later in the course of the disease (e.g. mild-to-moderate AD), and which did not enrich for A\u03b2-positive individuals, resulting in substantial misclassification (i.e. inclusion of participants without A\u03b2 pathology) [12, 241, 317] .\nBiomarkers hold promise for enabling more effective drug development in AD and establishing a more personalized medicine approach [126, 127, 314] ; they may soon become essential in staging, tracking, and providing a more quantitative categorization of the disease, as well as for documenting the effect of potential therapeutics. These points are underscored in the 2018 draft guidance documents issued by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Early Alzheimer's disease: developing drugs for treatment; draft guidance for industry) [96] and the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) (Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease) [78] . Fluid biomarkers have the potential to be easy to implement in clinical trials, and several biomarkers reflecting different pathophysiological mechanisms can be analyzed in the same sample. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood may provide a window for detection of some biomarkers that cannot be identified via brain imaging [125] .\nCSF represents a logical source for developing viable biomarkers in AD given its direct interaction with the extracellular space in the brain, thus potentially reflecting the associated pathophysiological alterations [32] . The overall safety record of lumbar puncture is strongly supported by extensive meta-analyses [76, 262] . However, fluid biomarkers are unable to reflect brain regional pathogeographies, which may be particularly important during early AD [47, 281] . Other limitations of CSF include the relative invasiveness of CSF collection by lumbar puncture, limited access and acceptability in some countries, the inability to collect samples from large populations especially if serial measures are needed, concerns over slowing for subject recruitment into clinical trials, educational gaps on the safety of lumbar puncture, development and validation of CSF assays, and clinical utility. Some of the limitations of CSF have prompted research efforts into the development and validation of diagnostic or prognostic AD biomarkers in blood [215, 216] . Indeed, the Biofluid Based Biomarkers Professional Interest Area [of the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART)], an international working group of leading AD scientists, has been established to scrutinize potential blood-based biomarkers and to provide standards for the collection of biofluids [128, 140, 268, 269] .\nThe ideal fluid biomarker for AD would be reliable, reproducible, non-invasive, simple to measure, and inexpensive [360] , as well as easy to implement into large populations such as clinical trials and the primary care setting. Importantly, biomarkers used in drug-development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU); these include (but are not limited to) patient/clinical trial diagnosis and subject selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug-response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reaction identification and minimization [95] . For successful AD drug development, it is critical to ensure that subjects enrolled into clinical trials are those who have AD pathology and are most likely to progress along the disease continuum. Fluid biomarkers could have an important role in clinical trial subject selection (including subject enrichment or stratification) [123, 126, 127] , and could be useful for measuring target engagement of the drug and the impact of the drug on the pathogenic mechanisms [184, 279] . Additionally, fluid biomarkers, especially blood biomarkers, could be used in early screening in primary care to identify potential clinical trial subjects and patients at risk of AD, thereby improving early diagnosis and enabling longitudinal tracking of various disease indicators over extended periods of time [22, 128] .\nCurrently, three core AD CSF biomarkers are included in research guidelines for AD and are being increasingly used in clinical trials as inclusion criteria and/or outcome measures: CSF amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau) [75, 214, 217, 247, 298] . These biomarkers have been validated as core CSF biomarkers of AD pathophysiology [33, 99, 122, 124] . Qualification opinions have also been published for CSF A\u03b242 and t-tau by the EMA, supporting their use as patient-selection tools [153] . Although these core biomarkers are now recognized for their diagnostic utility, there is a need to identify additional fluid biomarkers for other COUs such as subject enrichment, risk stratification, prognosis, and (eventually) drug-response monitoring, and to better understand the complex heterogeneity of AD pathology [78, 96] . Several novel biomarkers have been proposed; some have been extensively investigated, but they have yet to be validated and integrated into guidelines for use in clinical practice and drug development [99, 206] .\nThis review summarizes some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in sporadic AD ( Fig. 1 ) and highlights several established and novel fluid biomarkers associated with each mechanism. For each biomarker, a summary of published studies, the stage of assay development (Table 1) , and the potential COU (Table 2 ) are discussed. Most of the fluid biomarkers examined in this review are CSF biomarkers, owing to the limited number of published studies on bloodbased biomarkers. It should be noted that unselected biomarker combinations (\"panels\") identified through \"omics\" technologies are not included; this topic has been recently reviewed elsewhere [46, 219, 222, 260 ]."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease pathological mechanisms", "text": "Extracellular plaque deposits of A\u03b2 peptides and intraneuronal tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs), are the defining neuropathological features of AD brains [238, 314] . A\u03b2-plaque deposition is an insidious process that occurs over decades, well before symptoms emerge [156, 379] . Approximately one-third of people over the age of 65 years who are cognitively normal have A\u03b2-plaque deposition equivalent to that of someone with AD [305] ; the significance of this finding is a topic of intensive evaluation.\nIn AD, comorbid pathology is often present and contributes to the clinical symptoms. For example, there is an increasing burden of cerebrovascular pathology as a function of age, and approximately 30% of AD patients have concomitant cerebrovascular disease [365] . In addition to plaques and tangles, more than half of AD patients also show widespread cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites formed by misfolded \u03b1-synuclein like those found in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [121, 207] . Conversely, approximately 40% of DLB patients have AD pathology as determined by their CSF-biomarker profile [199] . Furthermore, up to half of AD patients harbour transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions that are characteristic of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [7, 50, 159] . Amylin deposits, which are found in the pancreas of most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, have also been found in AD (and type 2 diabetes) brains [157] . Thus, although AD is typically characterized by A\u03b2 plaques and NFTs, most AD patients have multiple pathologies and different types of brain proteinopathies [21] . In the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR) Brain Bank at the University of Pennsylvania, only 35% of 247 autopsy-confirmed AD brains examined for the presence of tau, A\u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein, and TDP-43 deposits had only plaques and tangles as the underlying cause of dementia, while 22% had all four of these pathologies [300] . This finding emphasizes the urgent need for biomarkers that can indicate the presence of multiple pathologies in AD patients, with the methodological attributes of being reliable, accessible, and cost-efficient."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 pathology", "text": "The \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\", initially proposed in 1992 [134] , but essentially embedded in the reports of the initial discovery of the partial A\u03b2 sequence in cerebral [17, 176, 194, 230, 257, 271, 347, [355] [356] [357] One study on plasma [355] Inconsistent results in CSF but most studies showed an increase Increased in plasma but data are limited"}, {"section_title": "Commercially available assays", "text": "Commercially available assays vessels [108, 109] and the whole 4 kDa A\u03b2 peptide in plaques [239] , is supported by genetic and biochemical data, and has been the dominant model of AD pathogenesis. The model is based on the gradual deposition of fibrillar A\u03b2 as diffuse plaques, which triggers an inflammatory response, altered ion homeostasis, oxidative stress, and altered kinase/ phosphatase activity, leading to the formation of NFTs and to widespread synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [320] . Notably, recent experimental evidence suggests that the A\u03b2 plaque environment can accelerate the templated spread of tau pathology [136] . Genetic data strongly implicate A\u03b2 in AD pathogenesis [315, 390] . Whether monomeric or aggregated forms are more relevant to the neurodegenerative process remains unknown. Recent reports indicate that soluble A\u03b2 oligomers may be more toxic than A\u03b2 neuritic plaques [320, 321] , suggesting that other forms of A\u03b2 may be more relevant to measure. Phase 3 clinical studies of solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets monomeric A\u03b2, resulted in very modest slowing of clinical decline [72] , whereas a Phase 1b study of aducanumab, a mAb that targets soluble and insoluble forms of aggregated A\u03b2, demonstrated robust plaque reduction and a slowing of clinical decline [42, 323] ."}, {"section_title": "Fluid biomarkers of A\u03b2 metabolism and aggregation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 peptides", "text": "A\u03b2 is generated as the result of the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase [45, 394] . The cleavage position of the \u03b3-secretase in the transmembrane domain of APP is imprecise, resulting in the production of A\u03b2 peptides of variable length [166, 289] . Changes in some of these A\u03b2 species have been associated with AD, as discussed below, but little is known about the changes over time in relation to clinical presentation."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b242", "text": "The 42-amino acid form of A\u03b2, A\u03b242, is a minor component of A\u03b2 peptides in the CSF [290] and plasma [277] , but in AD brains, A\u03b242 is the principal A\u03b2 peptide in plaques [113, 155] . Decreases in CSF A\u03b242 levels in AD patients were first reported by Motter et al. [256] . Several subsequent studies have consistently shown that CSF levels of A\u03b242 correlate inversely with plaque load as observed in autopsies and in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) [82, 114, 158, 343, 353] . CSF A\u03b243 is also reported to decrease in AD, but it has similar diagnostic accuracy to CSF A\u03b242 [39, 193] so research has focused on the latter. CSF A\u03b242, together with t-tau and p-tau, are biomarkers accepted as supportive of an AD diagnosis [75, 247] (Table 2) , and evidence suggests they may be prognostic of disease progression in both cognitively normal individuals [84, 209] and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [5, 9, 91, 133] . CSF A\u03b242 has the potential to discriminate AD from FTLD but shows significant overlap with other non-AD dementias [80] . The development of automated assays to measure CSF A\u03b242 will reduce variability among samples and laboratories and make it easier to interpret results and implement this biomarker into routine clinical practice [295] . However, several unresolved issues remain when using CSF A\u03b242 in clinical trials. First, there needs to be a better understanding of how to interpret changes in CSF A\u03b242 levels in AD in response to DMTs, since this is likely to vary with the mechanism of action of the DMT and with the duration of treatment. It seems logical to measure A\u03b242 to help determine target engagement of drugs designed to reduce A\u03b2 pathology [88, 208] ; however, some trials have reported changes in CSF A\u03b242 but no improvement in clinical endpoints [298] . Furthermore, truncated, post-translationally modified fragments of A\u03b2 (e.g. pyroglutamate A\u03b242) may be more prone to pathogenic aggregation [25, 117] , and consideration needs to be given to what forms of A\u03b242 are being measured. In addition, CSF A\u03b242 remains relatively stable over time in patients with AD dementia and may have limited utility for monitoring disease progression in this group [34, 41, 367, 402] . Finally, CSF A\u03b242 measures are influenced by preanalytical factors such as the type of collection tube and number of freeze/thaw cycles [198, 284, 368] , so it is essential to develop harmonized standard operating procedures for sample collection and handling, as established for biomarker studies in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [326, 327] .\nThere has been great interest in developing new techniques to measure A\u03b242 in blood. Although most studies have failed to show an association between plasma A\u03b242 alone and risk of AD or association with PET A\u03b2 [227, 271] , recent studies using ultrasensitive analytical assays as well as fully automated immunoassays suggest that plasma A\u03b2 could be a useful screening biomarker. Using an ultrasensitive immunoassay technique (Simoa platform), levels of A\u03b242 and the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in plasma were shown to correlate with CSF levels and with A\u03b2 deposition measured by PET [160, 377] , and plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 associated with risk of progression to MCI or dementia in cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive decline [377] . "}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Ovod et al. used mass spectrometry to demonstrate lower levels of plasma A\u03b242 and A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in subjects with an A\u03b2-positive PET [273] . In addition to the use of novel technologies, plasma samples could be chemically treated to reduce degradation of A\u03b2 and improve the accuracy of plasma A\u03b2 measurements [278] . Recently, a fully automated immunoassay has been shown to detect plasma A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 and accurately predict A\u03b2-positivity (using the CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio as reference standard) in cognitively normal, subjective cognitive decline, MCI and AD dementia patients [274] .\nIn summary, CSF A\u03b242 is widely accepted and used as an AD biomarker, and both CSF and plasma A\u03b242 continue to be intensively studied (Tables 1 and 2 ). CSF A\u03b242 is recognized as a core biomarker for AD diagnosis and is currently being considered by the FDA for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials ( Table 2 ). It shows great promise as a biomarker for prognosis and has the potential to be used during drug trials to help assess target engagement. Plasma A\u03b242 may prove to be useful for subject/patient selection (screening) and research is ongoing.

A\u03b240 may have protective effects against A\u03b2 plaque formation [180] but it is the relative amount of A\u03b240 to A\u03b242 that may be more important than the absolute amounts of either peptide [188] .\nResearch on CSF A\u03b240 and its correlation with AD dementia has shown inconsistent results [73, 248, 338] , and a meta-analysis by Olsson et al. (data from 25 AD cohorts and 24 control cohorts) found only a minor association [271] . One study demonstrated an association between PET A\u03b2 and CSF A\u03b240 levels (as well as CSF A\u03b238 and a combination of A\u03b240 and A\u03b238), although the association was stronger in individuals who were not carriers of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) \u03b54 allele (a major genetic risk factor for AD) compared with APOE \u03b54-positive individuals [243] . CSF A\u03b240 may be useful (together with other biomarkers) in assessing target engagement of drugs such as BACE1 inhibitors, which selectively decrease A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 [173] .\nAlthough CSF A\u03b240 shows no consistent change in AD across studies, the ratio of CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 has been shown to be a better predictor of A\u03b2-positive PET than CSF A\u03b242 alone [161, 202, 205, 276] , and comparable to the ratios of t-tau/A\u03b242 and p-tau/A\u03b242 [275, 294] . The A\u03b242/ A\u03b240 ratio also appears to be better than CSF A\u03b242 alone at distinguishing AD from non-AD dementias [73, 161] . Assessment of the CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio (together with CSF tau levels), instead of absolute levels of A\u03b242, may reduce misdiagnosis of cognitively normal individuals who are low A\u03b2 producers and AD patients who are high A\u03b2 producers [388] , and to correct for inter-individual differences in CSF dynamics. The use of the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio can also help to reduce the impact of pre-analytical factors affecting A\u03b242 (and A\u03b240) levels [104] .\nStudies on plasma A\u03b240 have had mixed results [160, 248] , but the meta-analysis by Olsson et al. (data from 21 AD cohorts and 19 control cohorts) found no difference between AD and controls [271] . In a separate study, plasma A\u03b240 did not correlate with A\u03b2-positive PET in cognitively normal elderly individuals [83] . However, as with CSF, the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in plasma may be more useful than A\u03b240 alone; plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 appears to be associated with an increased risk of progression to AD dementia [373, 377] , and has shown promise in detecting A\u03b2-positivity [87, 261, 273, 274, 371, 377] and supporting the diagnosis of AD [31, 179, 383] .\nOverall, the data suggest that CSF or plasma A\u03b240 alone has limited utility as a biomarker for AD diagnosis but could be used to confirm target engagement of certain drugs (Tables 1 and 2 ). The ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in CSF and plasma appears to be useful for subject/patient selection and may be superior to A\u03b242 alone (Table 2) . Additionally, fluidbased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 may be useful for prognosis but the data are limited. Commercial assays are available for fluid-based A\u03b240 (and A\u03b242), and IVD assays are available for CSF A\u03b240 (and A\u03b242) in Europe.

Neuronal and/or glial inclusions of tau can be detected in several neurodegenerative diseases, or \"tauopathies\", including AD [152], which may be characterized, to some extent, by their tau isoform profile [252] . The NFTs characteristic of AD are composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau [19, 196] .\nThe abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD has been hypothesized to be driven by A\u03b2 pathology [19, 177] , although transgenic mice genetically engineered to develop A\u03b2 plaques do not develop tau tangles [197] , except after intracerebral injections of AD brain-derived tau [136] .\nHyperphosphorylation of tau has several pathogenic effects. It reduces tau's affinity for microtubules, and increases its likelihood to aggregate and fibrillize [309] . This leads to destabilization of microtubules with subsequent axonal transport failure and neurodegeneration, which can be offset or corrected by microtubule-stabilizing drugs [24, 40, 405] . Hyperphosphorylation of tau is thought to cause its mislocalization to somatodendritic compartments, where it interacts with A\u03b2 to cause synaptotoxicity through the excessive activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [177] . In addition, hyperphosphorylation of tau is implicated in A\u03b2-induced cell death [200] , possibly via a toxic gain of function mechanism [89] .\nStudies have shown that the density of neocortical NFTs has a stronger correlation than A\u03b2 plaques with ante-mortem cognitive status (reviewed by Nelson et al.)

Both CSF t-tau and p-tau differentiate AD from controls, and given that CSF p-tau levels are normal in most other dementias, this biomarker is also important for differential diagnosis [33] . In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), CSF t-tau levels are very high (around 20 times higher than in AD), whereas p-tau is close to normal [297, 336] .

In the initial CSF study of the ADNI cohort, a logistic regression model combining A\u03b242, t-tau, and the APOE \u03b54 allele count showed a stronger association with mild AD than A\u03b242, t-tau, p-tau, or tau/A\u03b242 alone [326] . Both CSF t-tau/A\u03b242 and p-tau/A\u03b242 ratios have been shown to outperform any of the individual biomarkers for distinguishing individuals with an A\u03b2-positive PET [85] . In a study of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort, CSF t-tau/A\u03b240 and p-tau/A\u03b242 were the best discriminators of autopsy-confirmed AD from controls [319] . The combination of CSF tau and A\u03b242, in particular, p-tau/A\u03b242, has also shown promise for differentiating AD from other dementias [299, 319] .\nThe combination of tau and A\u03b2 markers has also demonstrated their utility for predicting disease progression. CSF t-tau/A\u03b242 and p-tau/A\u03b242 have been shown to predict cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals [84] , and the combination or ratios of tau (t-tau or p-tau) and A\u03b242 have been shown to be better at predicting progression from MCI to AD than the individual biomarkers [91, 374] . Furthermore, the EMA approved CSF A\u03b242/t-tau for use as an enrichment biomarker in a study of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor [77] . More recently, the synergistic interaction between CSF p-tau and A\u03b2 imaging was found to be associated with the progression from MCI to AD dementia [280] .\nCSF t-tau and p-tau are frequently measured in clinical trials but, as with CSF A\u03b242, the relationship between clinical endpoints or therapeutic drug (interventional) response and these biomarkers is unclear [298] , owing to their small longitudinal variation [34, 41] and the lack of DMTs that precludes testing their performance. Other challenges include variability in measured values due to pre-analytical and analytical factors, and the lack of consensus on cut-off values [98] . However, it is feasible that CSF tau could be used to assess target engagement of tau-targeted drugs [174, 363] .\nIn addition to the CSF tau biomarkers, plasma tau has also been evaluated and has shown potential for clinical utility. The meta-analysis by Olsson et al. (data from six AD cohorts and five control cohorts) found an association between plasma t-tau and AD [271] ; however, no significant difference in plasma t-tau has been reported between MCI subjects and controls [61, 245, 404] . Elevated plasma t-tau is associated with lower grey matter density but the brain atrophy pattern associated with plasma t-tau is different from that of CSF t-tau [68] . Longitudinally, higher levels of plasma t-tau have been associated with greater cognitive decline and risk of MCI [245, 251] . Notably, the relationship between plasma t-tau and cognition was independent of elevated brain A\u03b2 [251] . These findings suggest that plasma t-tau could be useful as a screening tool or a prognostic marker for non-specific cognitive decline in cases where acute central nervous system (CNS) injury has been ruled out. Blood-based p-tau has also been measured in a few recent studies and found to be elevated in AD patients [329, 358, 395] and MCI subjects [329, 395] compared with controls. In addition, platelet-derived tau has been explored, and preliminary studies suggest that the ratio of high molecular weight to low molecular weight tau is higher in AD than in controls [264, 337] . However, the role of platelet-derived tau is not clear; it could either be a confounder or help to clarify the relationship between central and peripheral compartment tau measurements.\nAlthough most tau biomarker research has focused on t-tau and p-tau, studies suggest that a variety of other tau peptides and fragments can be detected in CSF [250] and in serum [150] , and some may have potential as AD biomarkers. For example, one study found that 11 (of 47) different tau phosphopeptides were upregulated in AD patients relative to controls [306] , while another study found that non-phosphorylated tau also has potential as a diagnostic biomarker [204] . These initial studies may lead to further research into novel tau biomarkers, which may be especially helpful in the development of tau-directed therapies.\nIn summary, CSF t-tau and p-tau are widely accepted and used in AD research (Tables 1 and 2 ). They are recognized as core biomarkers to support the diagnosis of AD and are currently being considered for qualification by the FDA for subject selection in clinical trials (Table 2 ). CSF tau also shows promise as a biomarker for prognosis and target engagement. Commercial assays are available for both CSF t-tau and p-tau, including IVD assays in Europe and fully automated assays. There has been recent renewed interest in plasma t-tau, which shows potential for subject/patient selection (screening) and for prognosis (Table 2 ). In addition, research into other tau biomarkers (blood-based p-tau, platelet-derived tau, tau peptides/fragments) is ongoing but is still in its early stages."}, {"section_title": "Vascular dysregulation", "text": "Concurrent cerebrovascular disease is more common in AD than in most other neurodegenerative disorders [365] and vascular dysregulation as a contributing factor to AD has been a long-standing hypothesis for AD pathogenesis [296, 340] . The time sequence of the impact of vascular dysregulation has been debated, but recent work supports the possibility that these changes may be an early pathological event that precedes A\u03b2 pathology. The spatiotemporal changes in various neuroimaging, plasma, and CSF biomarkers from the ADNI cohort, suggest that vascular dysregulation is the earliest and strongest pathological factor associated with late-onset AD, followed by A\u03b2 deposition, glucose metabolism dysregulation, functional impairment, and grey matter atrophy [154] .\nVascular dysregulation reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain, causing cell damage and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, which lead in turn to neurotoxic effects such as oxidative stress and inflammation [69] . The hypoxic conditions are thought to increase the accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides through the activation of BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase [307] .

They have important roles in homeostasis, synaptogenesis, signal transmission, and synaptic plasticity, and provide trophic and metabolic support to neurons [342] .\nThe activation of glial cells serves to protect the brain; however, uncontrolled and prolonged activation can lead to detrimental effects that override the beneficial effects [37] . In this condition, glial cells lose some of their homeostatic functions and acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype. The release of pro-inflammatory molecules, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide contribute to neuronal cell death.

Rare TREM2 gene variants have been associated with an increased risk of developing AD [59, 116, 304, 332] .

Increased CSF ferritin levels were associated with cognitive decline and predicted progression from MCI to AD, regardless of APOE genotype [15] . In a subsequent analysis, CSF ferritin was associated with cognitive decline in cognitively normal subjects, but the association was strongest in APOE \u03b54 carriers [14] . In the same cohort, high CSF ferritin was associated with accelerated depreciation of CSF A\u03b242 in subjects with a high tau/A\u03b242 ratio [13] . Plasma ferritin levels showed a modest correlation with CSF levels, but unlike CSF ferritin, there was no difference in plasma ferritin between APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers [15] . In another study, plasma ferritin levels were elevated in cognitively normal subjects with A\u03b2 pathology identified by PET when adjusted for covariates (age, sex, APOE \u03b54 status, and levels of C-reactive protein), although ferritin alone had a relatively minor effect compared with the base model (derived from logistic regression of the same covariates) [112] .\nIn summary, the data are limited but a small number of studies suggest that both CSF and plasma ferritin may be useful as AD biomarkers (Table 1) . CSF ferritin may have a role as a prognostic biomarker, whereas plasma ferritin could be used for subject/patient selection (screening) to help identify preclinical AD (Table 2) ; however, further studies by independent groups are needed to validate the initial findings.

CSF VILIP-1 was identified through mouse gene array analyses as being abundantly produced in the brain [192] . It was subsequently associated with AD and found to correlate with CSF t-tau and p-tau [194] , supporting its use as a neurodegeneration marker.\nCSF VILIP-1 levels have been shown to be higher in patients with AD compared with controls in several studies [194, 230, 257, 347, 355] , although one study found no significant difference [176] . The meta-analysis by Olsson et al. found VILIP-1 to have a moderate association with AD (data from four AD and control cohorts) with around 50% higher levels in AD than in controls [271] . AD patients had higher levels than MCI subjects in one study [257] but no difference was noted in a later study [17] . In a recent study of the ADNI cohort, baseline CSF VILIP-1 levels were higher in A\u03b2-positive (based on CSF A\u03b242) MCI and AD subjects compared with both the A\u03b2-negative MCI and A\u03b2-negative cognitively normal groups [347] . No significant differences were found between any of the A\u03b2-positive subsets of the cognitively normal, MCI, and AD groups. CSF VILIP-1 levels decreased longitudinally in the AD group (mean follow-up was 4 years) but there were no significant longitudinal changes in any other group [347] . CSF VILIP-1 may be prognostic of future cognitive decline [355] , rates of cognitive decline [357] , rates of brain atrophy [356] , and progression from MCI to AD [176] . In addition, studies suggest that CSF VILIP-1 can diagnostically differentiate AD from other dementias [17, 230, 355] .\nData on plasma VILIP-1 are limited; plasma levels were found to be higher in patients with mild AD compared with controls in one study, although the difference was more significant in CSF than in plasma [355] .\nOverall, the data for VILIP-1 suggest a possible role in subject/patient selection and prognosis (Tables 1 and 2) but study results have varied so further research is warranted. Commercial assays are available."}, {"section_title": "NF-L", "text": "Neurofilaments are intermediate filaments expressed in neurons and are particularly abundant in axons [398] . They are composed of four subunits-neurofilament light (NF-L), neurofilament middle (NF-M), neurofilament heavy (NF-H), and \u03b1-internexin in the CNS, and NF-L, NF-M, NF-H, and peripherin in the peripheral nervous system [398] . Neurofilaments are essential for the radial growth of axons during development, structural support, and the transmission of electrical impulses [398] . Recent research suggests that they are also important for normal synaptic function [399] . Abnormal aggregation and other alterations of neurofilaments are evident in several neurological diseases including AD [378, 398, 399] and in the LBs of PD [316] .\nCSF levels of the NF-L subunit are known to be increased in several neurodegenerative diseases, supporting its role as a marker of axonal injury [231, 286, 334] . CSF NF-L levels have been shown to be higher in AD [4, 220, 288, 334, 403] and MCI patients [403] compared with controls, and correlate with cognitive impairment and short survival time in patients with dementia [335] . The meta-analysis by Olsson et al. found CSF NF-L to have a large effect size for differentiating between AD patients and controls (data from nine AD cohorts and eight control cohorts) [271] . CSF NF-L correlates with brain atrophy [282, 403 ], but appears not to be specific for AD since levels are elevated in other neurodegenerative diseases, likely reflecting non-specific axonal injury [28, 103, 282] . In multiple sclerosis (MS), CSF NF-L has been shown to correlate with clinical and radiological outcomes, making it potentially useful for monitoring response to therapy [182, 249, 266, 267] .\nRecently, there has been great interest in the potential utility of NF-L in blood as a biomarker for several neurodegenerative diseases including AD, MS, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), ALS, and Huntington's disease [43, 71, 228, 240, 302, 385, 408] , as well as a marker of traumatic brain injury [224, 324] . In AD, plasma or serum levels of NF-L have been shown to be elevated compared with controls in presymptomatic individuals known to be carriers of AD-causing gene mutations [385] and subjects with MCI or AD [240, 408] . Furthermore, blood-based NF-L appears to correlate with poor cognition and brain atrophy [240, 385] . In MS, serum NF-L has demonstrated potential as a biomarker for monitoring response to DMTs and predicting relapse [71] , and in PSP, plasma NF-L has been shown to predict disease progression [302] .\nTaken together, these findings indicate that both CSF and plasma NF-L are promising biomarkers, although the specific COU has not been determined given that changes are observed in various neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD (Tables 1 and 2 ). Potentially, CSF NF-L could be useful as a non-specific marker of axonal injury and for prognosis, and recent research gives hope that plasma NF-L could be used as a non-invasive biomarker for subject/patient selection (screening) and prognosis ( Table 2) . Commercial assays are available and IVD assays are available for CSF NF-L in Europe."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In addition to the established core CSF biomarkers, A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau, several candidate fluid biomarkers show potential for clinical use in AD, particularly to support diagnosis (and clinical trial subject selection) and prognosis (or assessment of disease state) ( Table 2) . Of all the biomarkers reviewed, CSF A\u03b242, t-tau, p-tau, and the ratio of tau/A\u03b242 are already accepted for use as diagnostic biomarkers, while several other biomarkers hold promise for future use (Table 1) . Further studies are needed for the validation and regulatory qualification of all these biomarkers. In addition, the relationship between the biomarkers and clinical presentation (i.e. cognitive measures), as well as the effects of patient variables (e.g. sex, APOE \u03b54 status) on biomarker changes need to be investigated.\nIt should be noted that only a selection of promising biomarkers has been included in this review, and many other candidates are being studied at present. As well as other protein/peptide markers and panels [206] , nonprotein analytes such as lipids [8] , amino acids [56] , and microRNAs [120, 328] are being explored. Advances in technologies such as mass spectrometry enable the precise measurement of analytes, helping to identify new candidate biomarkers [26] as well as supporting harmonization efforts for the core biomarkers [292] .\nOf all the possible biomarker COUs, there appears to be an unmet need for validated fluid biomarkers for drug development, especially for monitoring response to therapy and adverse reactions ( Table 2) . This is not surprising given the current absence of approved DMTs but highlights the need for fluid-based surrogate biomarkers of drug efficacy and safety. The important role of biomarkers in AD drug development has been highlighted in the FDA draft guidance for industry [96] .\nFurther development of candidate biomarkers, as well as identification of new ones, would benefit greatly from a unified and coordinated approach [100, 124, 178, 269] . There is a need to reach a consensus on the areas that require the most focus and to implement effective strategies to advance the field. This effort requires collaboration among academia, industry, laboratory managers, and clinicians, at an international level.\nAn ever-increasing number of biomarkers are being researched, and studies have a considerable degree of heterogeneity (biomarker collection/methodology, disease diagnosis/stage of disease, and characterization of comorbid CNS diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases), making it difficult to interpret results and establish how the biomarkers fit within the stages of AD pathogenesis. Publication bias may be a barrier in this step, as \"negative\" studies may be under-published. To fast-track data dissemination, a centralized database would be useful to share individual patient-level biomarker data. The Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD), one of 12 consortia of the Critical Path Institute (C-Path), aims to include CSF biomarker data in a central repository as part of their ongoing initiative to advance regulatory drug development tools [12] .\nOnce the data gaps are identified, studies can be designed to address the specific unmet needs. Careful planning of study design, subjects, and methodology is critical, to ensure that data gaps are appropriately addressed and that outcomes are reliable and representative of a wider population. The COU should be decided from the outset, and this will influence the subject inclusion criteria and study design. For example, studies on biomarkers for preclinical AD should enroll cognitively normal subjects with evidence of AD pathology and include longitudinal follow-ups and biomarker measurements over 5 years or more.\nFor studies to provide meaningful and comparable data, a concerted effort needs to be made to reduce heterogeneity in study methodologies. The development and/or update of consensus recommendations and guidelines should help in this regard, for example, by standardizing diagnostic criteria for different stages of the AD continuum, pre-analytical variables, assays, threshold values, and study designs and populations used for any given COU. The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) is currently updating a research framework for AD, which will help to harmonize subject selection and disease staging in future studies. There have been longstanding efforts to better understand and control for pre-analytical sources of variability in CSF AD biomarkers, and consensus conferences have defined these [375] . A CSF pre-analytics consortium, sponsored by the Alzheimer's Association is working to develop a consensus regarding remaining pre-analytical factors such as tube plastic type and other collection parameters that can be implemented into routine clinical practice. Factors that had been recognized but incompletely understood, such as the effect of tube type and CSF volume involved in transfer steps, were recently described and will help to clarify the potential impact of such factors on CSF AD biomarker measurements [386] . The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry Working Group for CSF proteins (IFCC WG-CSF) is an international joint effort to develop reference measurement procedures (RMP) and certified reference materials (CRM) with the aim of standardizing CSF biomarkers and harmonizing read-outs between assay formats [185] . To date, two Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) -approved RMPs and three CRMs for CSF A\u03b242 are available, and work on A\u03b240 and tau proteins is ongoing. In parallel with the recent drive to standardize CSF pre-analytics, guidelines have also been proposed by the Biofluid Based Biomarkers Professional Interest Area (of ISTAART) for the pre-analytical processing of blood-based AD biomarkers [268] . Furthermore, \"Appropriate use criteria for CSF in clinical practice\" are also being developed by the Alzheimer's Association, which will help define the use of AD CSF biomarkers by clinicians for assessment of cognitive decline and impairment.\nAlthough biomarkers are routinely included in drug studies for understanding target engagement and for patient enrichment, the hurdles are high for biomarker adoption to inform standard of care in daily clinical practice. Health agencies have recognized the importance of biomarkers, and both the FDA and EMA have developed pathways to accelerate biomarker qualification for clinical trials [12] . To achieve biomarker qualification, evidence is needed that the biomarker can reliably support a specified manner of interpretation and application in drug development for a specifically stated COU [12] . Therefore, the aforementioned hurdles, such as data sharing and standardization of study methods, are important to address at the earliest stages of biomarker research. Once a biomarker has been shown to be useful for a specific COU in the clinical trial setting, measures can be taken to further develop it as a companion biomarker useful to practitioners.\nThe ultimate goal in AD is to follow the approach developed in the more advanced research field of oncology and deliver precision medicine to all patients, in such a way that diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are \"tailored\" to the characteristics of the individual according to the precision medicine paradigm [46, 92, 126, 127, 129, 130] . In this context, the precision medicine strategy enables a paradigm shift from the traditional \"one treatment fits all\" approach in drug discovery towards biomarker-guided \"tailored\" therapies, i.e. targeted interventions adapted to the biological profile of the individual patient. In this regard, the US Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) (https ://obama white house .archi ves.gov/preci sion-medic ine) and the US All of Us Research Program (https ://allof us.nih.gov/)-formerly known as and evolved from the US PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP)-have been inaugurated recently. As is the case in most fields of medicine, important progress in detecting, treating, and preventing AD is anticipated from the implementation of a systematic precision medicine strategy. Therefore, after more than a decade of failed therapy trials and one of the lowest success rates in drug development in medicine, the time has come to launch an international Alzheimer PMI (APMI) and associate it with the US PMI and other related worldwide initiatives [92, 126, 127, 129, 130] .
