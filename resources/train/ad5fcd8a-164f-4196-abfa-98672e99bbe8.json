To measure [\n11 C]PiB retention, distribution volume ratios (DVR) for 15 regions of interest were estimated by fitting a simplified reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves. Mixed effects regression was used to predict cognitive trajectories over time using data before and including time of PiB (mean follow-up 10.8 years), with mean cortical DVR, age at baseline, sex, and education as independent predictors.

The distribution volume ratios (DVRs) of ROIs were estimated by simultaneous fitting of a simplified reference tissue model using linear regression with spatial constraints (SRTM-LRSC) to the 15 measured ROI time activity curves. 14 The mean cortical DVR was calculated by averaging DVR values from orbitofrontal, prefrontal, superior frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate regions.

Mean cortical A\u2424 burden and longitudinal cognitive decline. PiB mDVR was not associated significantly with baseline level of cognitive performance for mental status or measures of domain-specific cognitive performance under any model. (Similar results were obtained restricting the regression analysis to the baseline cognitive assessment only.) However, in analyses including all participants, higher PiB mDVR was associated with longitudinal decline in mental status (MMSE) and verbal immediate (sum of 5 CVLT List A trials) and delayed free recall under both models (measuring cognitive change prior to and concurrent with the [ 11 C]PiB scan). PiB mDVR was not associated significantly with longitudinal change in measures of executive function. Estimates (SE) of these associations reflect change in rates of annual declines in scores per unit of greater PiB retention with adjustment for baseline age and education: MMSE \u03ea0.13 (0.05), CVLT Immediate Recall \u03ea1.35 (0.44), CVLT Delayed Recall \u03ea0.32 (0.11), all p \u0545 0.01. To illustrate these associations, mean and estimated individual trajectories of cognitive change are shown by tertiles of mDVR (\u03fd1.045, 1.045-1.345, \u03fe1.345) for MMSE, CVLT immediate, and delayed free recall in figure 2 , A through C.\nThe relationships between mental status ( p \u03fd 0.01) and CVLT immediate recall ( p \u03ed 0.02) remained significant in both models after excluding the 6 participants with CDR \u03ed 0.5, but PiB mDVR was no longer associated with decline in CVLT delayed free recall ( p \u03ed 0.06). Estimates (SE) of these associations with adjustment for baseline age and education were as follows: MMSE \u03ea0.15 (0.05), CVLT Immediate Recall \u03ea1.03 (0.45), CVLT Delayed Recall \u03ea0.22 (0.11). Additionally, longitudinal decline in executive function (Trails B seconds) was associated with higher PiB mDVR when only CDR \u03ed 0 individuals were included in the analysis (estimate \u03ed 2.86, SE \u03ed 1.20, p \u03ed 0.02; figure 2D ).\nRegional A\u2424 burden and cognitive decline. Correlations between regional A\u2424 burden and declines in CVLT immediate and delayed verbal memory and mental status performance are presented in table e-1 and figure 3. Voxel-based analysis, adjusted for baseline age, showed that higher A\u2424 deposition in frontal and temporal regions and putamen was associated with greater decline in verbal memory and mental status. Declines in MMSE were associated with greater PiB retention in inferior, middle, and superior frontal regions, as well as left middle temporal gyrus and right insula. Declines in CVLT immediate and delayed free recall were associated with A\u2424 deposition in putamen, inferior, middle, and superior frontal regions, temporal pole, lingual gyrus, and precuneus, with more widespread correlations in lateral temporal regions for delayed free recall. There were no significant associations observed for the posterior cingulate region or medial temporal regions. The relationship between rates of change in Trails B, a measure of executive function, and A\u2424 burden was more robust in analyses restricted to cognitively normal individuals with CDR \u03ed 0 (table e-2, figure 4) , confirming the analysis based on mDVR. Higher levels of A\u2424 deposition in frontal and parietal regions, including precuneus, were associated with declines in executive function. DISCUSSION In this series of 57 BLSA-NI participants with longitudinal cognitive assessments, we found that higher [\n11 C]PiB retention was associated with steeper trajectories of cognitive decline in the years preceding and concurrent with the PiB evaluation. Specifically, higher [ 11 C]PiB was associated with longitudinal decline in mental status and verbal episodic memory although mean cortical [ 11 C]PiB retention was not related to baseline level of performance on any of the cognitive measures. Six individuals in our sample had mild memory loss by CDR, but only one met consensus criteria for MCI at the time of the study. Associations between higher A\u2424 burden and decline in mental status and immediate free recall remained significant after exclusion of these individuals, and additionally, decline in executive function was associated with higher servations of cross-sectional associations reported in some studies, 7,16 although we did not find significant relationships between baseline cognitive function and A\u2424 burden. Higher [\n11 C]PiB retention in association with greater longitudinal decline in verbal recall is also consistent with the sole longitudinal report, 8 which indicated that older adults without dementia who show declines in word list recall are more likely to have higher [\n11 C]PiB retention compared to individuals with stable clinical status and verbal recall. Furthermore, our findings hold even after excluding individuals who had developed very mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that associations between PiB retention and cognitive change emerge early in the disease process before clinical symptoms are apparent.\nAlthough higher [ 11 C]PiB retention was associated with decline in verbal recall performance, we observed no significant associations between [ 11 C]PiB retention and longitudinal change in BVRT performance, a measure of short-term visual memory which declines early in the course of AD. 3, 12 The lack of association between BVRT performance and [\n11 C]PiB retention has also been reported in cross-sectional studies. 7 It is possible that the lack of an association for BVRT reflects greater sensitivity of this measure to mesial temporal dysfunction and the low level of A\u2424 deposition visualized by [ 11 C]PiB in mesial temporal structures. In contrast, the CVLT is sensitive to frontal as well as temporal function, due to its greater dependence on the capacity to organize serial and semantic information. Voxel-based analyses offer support for this explanation, as CVLT associations with [ 11 C]PiB retention were observed for prefrontal and lateral temporal but not mesial temporal regions. This explanation also receives some support from our observed association between decline in frontal executive function, as measured by Trails B, and [\n11 C]PiB retention in individuals with CDR \u03ed 0 (which reached only trend level in the In postmortem studies, we compared antemortem cognitive function in a selected group of individuals who remained clinically stable until death despite AD pathology (asymptomatic AD) with groups of clinically and neuropathologically normal controls and clinically and neuropathologically abnormal AD and MCI. In contrast, our in vivo [\n11 C]PiB studies include a mixed group of individuals who will remain cognitively normal as well as those who will go on to develop cognitive impairment and AD. An important difference between our autopsy sample and the in vivo study is the age at which A\u2424 burden was measured. Mean ages (years) in the autopsy sample were 78.6 for controls, 85.8 for cognitively normal subjects with pathology, and 89.4 for subjects with MCI/AD, whereas mean age in the imaging sample was 78.8 years. Thus, participants with elevated A\u2424 burden in the imaging sample were less likely to have passed fully through the risk period for cognitive impairment, and individuals with elevated [ 11 C]PiB values and cognitive decline may represent those most likely to develop AD. 8 An additional advantage of in vivo imaging of A\u2424 deposition is that it enables prospective evaluation of individuals with elevated A\u2424 burden who remain cognitively stable vs those who eventually show more marked cognitive decline and impairment. Such studies may aid in identifying possible protective and compensatory factors that allow some individuals with neuropathology to retain cognitive health.\nLimitations of our study include the small sample size and the fact that [\n11 C]PiB imaging was not possible at baseline cognitive assessment. In addition, the BLSA is a highly educated community dwelling sample, which limits the generality of our findings. However, the incidence of AD in the BLSA 12 and the rates of brain changes 17 are comparable to other samples. Our study also has several strengths. BLSA-NI participants were followed prospectively for at least 8 years prior to initial [ 11 C]PiB evaluation, and cognitive status was determined within the context of these longitudinal assessments, with 51 participants rated as CDR \u03ed 0 at the time of [ 11 C]PiB evaluation. While we do not yet know which individuals will eventually develop cognitive impairment, our analyses represent a snapshot in time and the fact that most individuals have had stable cognition over \u05468 years increases the likelihood that the majority of participants will remain clinically normal through the next few years of follow-up. Another strength of our study is that our outcome measures of episodic memory, including the CVLT and BVRT, are not used in determination of diagnostic status. Thus, associations between [ 11 C]PiB retention and change on these measures are determined independently of clinical determinations of cognitive status.\nContinued longitudinal assessments of A\u2424 deposition in conjunction with cognitive performance and diagnostic status will provide insights into behavioral manifestations and the pathobiology of disease progression at the earliest stages of the neurodegenerative disease process. In vivo imaging of neuropathology has the potential to identify not only risk factors for clinical manifestation of disease, but also to elucidate possible protective and compensatory factors that maintain cognitive health in successful aging."}]
