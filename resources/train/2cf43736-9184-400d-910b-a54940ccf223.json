[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long been viewed as a discrete, non-progressive neurological insult, whereby the brain remains stable once acute damage (eg, edema, gliosis) has resolved. 1, 2 This view has recently been questioned, and a novel conceptualization of moderatesevere TBI as a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder has emerged, with growing findings of ongoing losses to brain volume and white matter integrity in the chronic stages of injury. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] To date, little is known about the mechanisms of these progressive changes. 1 significantly related to degeneration of the temporal lobes, with the strongest effects in the right temporal pole and right anterior hippocampus (HPC). We therefore examined the relationship between self-reported anxiety symptoms and HPC atrophy in moderate-severe TBI.\nIn this prospective, longitudinal study of adults with moderate-severe TBI, we examined the temporal relationship between anxiety symptoms and volume change in terms of total HPC volume and subdivisions along the longitudinal axis of the HPC (ie, head, body, and tail). We predicted that higher symptoms of anxiety at 5 and 12 months post-TBI would predict greater HPC volume loss from, respectively, 5 to 12 and 12 to 30 months post-injury, particularly in the head region (ie, anterior HPC). These hypotheses were formed based on the findings of Mah et al 9 and Sturm et al 10 as well as the vulnerability of the HPC head to damage after TBI, 15 and its known role in anxiety (as demonstrated in animal 16 and human 17 studies)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participant data were drawn from a larger, prospective, longitudinal study of recovery from TBI (the Toronto TBI Recovery Study) 18 for which collection of the relevant data for the current study (ie, Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI] and MRI data) commenced in 2004. Primary inclusion criteria for the larger study were as follows: (1) a clinically confirmed moderate-severe TBI as indexed by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 19 score of 12 or less and/or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) 20 lasting 24 hours or more; (2) resolution of PTA by 3 months post-injury; (3) age between 17 and 80 years; (4) functional use of at least one upper extremity; and, (5) functional command of English. Exclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) a diagnosis of a disease affecting the central nervous system (e.g., AD, multiple sclerosis, lupus); (2) history of psychotic disorder; and (3) a prior TBI or stroke. Participants in the Toronto TBI Recovery Study underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 time points, averaging 5.1 months (SD = 1.0; range = 3.7-10.4; N = 80), 12.7 months (SD = 1.7; range = 6.4-17.6; N = 61), and 30.3 months (SD = 6.9; range = 23.0-56.1; N = 50) post-injury. For the current analyses, additional inclusion criteria were the completion of the BAI and MRI for at least 2 of the 3 assessments. Incomplete data were due to participants either (1) deciding not to participate further in the study, (2) missing their 12-month assessment, but returning at 30 months or (3) not yet having reached the final (30-month post-TBI) assessment at the time of this study. Eighty of 159 participants from the larger study met this extra inclusion criterion and were therefore included in the study (see Supplementary Table 1) .\nParticipants' demographic information and injury severity information are presented in Table 1 .

Outcome measures included left and right HPC total volume, as well as volumes for the left and right HPC head, body, and tail. Manual tracing of the right and left HPC was completed with Analyze 8.1 (Brain Imaging Resource, Mayo Clinic, MN) by a single expert tracer, Dr Jerome Maller (Dr Maller has more than 10 years of MRI tracing experience and has developed a handbook for structural MRI analysis), [22] [23] [24] from coronally oriented MR images in the anterior-posterior direction, as detailed by Maller et al 22 and Watson et al. 25 Here, a strict measurement protocol 22 including the assessment of intrarater reliability for 10 randomly selected cases was employed. For the HPC head and body, intraclass correlation (IC) was 0.99 for the right and >0.99 for the left, and for the HPC tail IC was 0.98 for the right and 0.99 for the left, indicating high intrarater reliability. 22 The HPC in this sample ranged from ~30-50 slices (ie, 3-5 cm) and each took ~30-40 minutes to be manually outlined. All raw HPC volumes are expressed in mm 3 . Volumes were automatically computed by multiplying 22 for a fuller description of the HPC tracing methods used in this study.) HPC total and substructure volume change scores used in our correlational analyses were calculated using the following formula: ([V2 -V1] / [V1+V2]) \u00d7 100, where V1 = volume of a given structure at time 1 and V2 = volume of a structure at time 2. Total brain volume (TBV) was calculated as gray plus white matter.

Note that we used the average score from across time points because repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in these values across time at the group level, F(2, 90) = 1.33, P = .27.\nWe tested the relationship of other potential control variables with the primary anxiety and HPC variables. Because of their known associations with HPC volume, the candidate covariates were the GCS (the most widely used measure of injury severity in TBI), 19 anxiety/antidepressant medication use, 38 TBV at 5 months post-injury, 22 age, years of education (YOE), and sex."}, {"section_title": "39,40", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design and Procedures", "text": "For the current study, a secondary analysis of prospectively collected longitudinal data was employed.

If either the left or the right HPC volume change scores were significantly correlated with anxiety symptoms, it would be carried forward to the BLDS analyses. We also carried out bivariate correlations to determine which covariates to include in the BLDS models. Potential covariates for the BLDS models were GCS, TBV at 5 months post-injury, anxiety/antidepressant medication use, age, YOE, and sex in addition to depression. Candidate covariates were included in the BLDS models if they correlated significantly (P < .05 on a 2-tailed test) with a BAI or HPC variable.\nBivariate Latent Difference Score Modeling. BLDS modeling was used to explore the temporal relationship of anxiety symptoms with HPC volume. The BLDS method simultaneously models two univariate LDS (ULDS) models (eg, models of anxiety and right HPC total complex volume; see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 1) with cross-lag regression paths from a static latent variable score to the opposite variable's subsequent latent change score (depicted graphically in Supplementary Figure 2) . Using this approach, a previous anxiety score can be used to predict subsequent change in HPC volume, and a previous HPC volume score can be used to predict subsequent change in anxiety scores.

Similarly, BAI scores averaged across 12-and 30-month assessments correlated significantly with total right HPC volume change from 12 to 30 months after injury (r = \u2212.37, P = .01). There were no statistically significant correlations of left HPC total volume change scores with average anxiety scores observed for either set of correlations, and effect sizes were small. Further, static right HPC total and head volumes did not concurrently correlate with anxiety scores at 5, 12, or 30 months post-TBI.\nOf the candidate covariates included in the correlational analyses with the BAI and the HPC variables, only TBV showed a statistically significant relationship (Supplementary  Table 3 ), and it was therefore incorporated into the BLDS models.

Results showed that higher anxiety scores at 5 and 12 months post-TBI significantly predicted subsequent reductions in right HPC total and head volumes from 5 to 12 months (CR = \u22122.06 for HPC total; CR = \u22121.86 for HPC head) and from 12 to 30 months (CR = \u22122.22 for HPC total; CR = \u22122.24 for HPC head) post-TBI (see cross-lag coefficients \u03b3 a and \u03b3 b in the \"Anxiety\" columns of Table 4 ).\nMore specifically, a 1-point increase on the BAI at 5 months post-TBI significantly predicted a reduction in right HPC total volume of 34. post-TBI, respectively (see cross-lag coefficients \u03b3 a and \u03b3 b in the \"R HPC Total\" and \"R HPC Head\" columns of Table 4 ).

Understanding what factors play a role in HPC volume loss is important for the identification of treatment targets. We undertook to examine the role of self-reported anxiety symptoms in HPC volume loss in chronic TBI. We predicted that anxiety scores at 5 and 12 months would significantly predict reductions in HPC volume from 5 to 12 and from 12 to 30 months post-TBI, respectively, and we expected to see these relationships most strongly for the HPC head bilaterally. In support of our hypotheses, analyses showed that these relationships were significant for the right HPC total, and right HPC head volume, when controlling for depressive symptoms and TBV. Notably, right HPC total and substructure volumes from 5 to 12 and from 12 to 30 months post-TBI did not significantly predict anxiety change scores, suggesting a unidirectional effect of anxiety symptoms on change in volumes of the right HPC total and head in our sample. These findings converge with previous studies documenting an association of anxiety with atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures in a MCI and AD 9 as well as social anxiety disorder. 43 Although HPC volume loss across participants in this study was observed bilaterally, anxiety symptoms predicted volume loss in the right HPC, but not the left, a finding which was not consistent with our hypothesis that the relationship would be observed bilaterally. Further, the relationship between anxiety and the HPC was observed with the right HPC head, but not the body and tail, raising the question whether the right HPC head has a unique vulnerability to anxiety symptoms in TBI. Our findings coincide with those of Sturm et al, 10 who found that emotional contagion (related to anxiety, particularly in social situations) [11] [12] [13] [14] was significantly associated with atrophy in the right anterior HPC (ie, the HPC head), but not the posterior right HPC or any region of the left HPC. Also, consistent with the localization of our findings to the right HPC, previous studies of HPC morphometry in social anxiety disorder have shown significantly smaller right, but not left, HPC volumes relative to controls. 43 Though the findings of Sturm et al 10 were correlational, the authors speculated that higher emotional contagion was likely a consequence, rather than a predictor, of the observed volume loss in right temporal lobe structures. Their interpretation that damage to the right anterior HPC may precipitate emotional dysfunction is supported by previous findings that the ventral HPC in rodents (which is functionally analogous to the anterior HPC/HPC head in humans) plays a functional role in anxiety. 44 In the context of human TBI, it is important to consider that a dynamic relationship may exist between anxiety and the HPC. While we did not find evidence that HPC volume loss predicted increased anxiety across the timelines studied, it is possible that HPC atrophy caused by the acute injuries may have resulted in elevated anxiety. For example, previous research into the relationship between anxiety and the HPC suggests that compromise to the HPC (particularly the dentate gyrus) could give rise to elevated anxiety. 45 Our data did not provide support for a dynamic 48, 49 ; thus, the mechanism for the relationship between anxiety symptoms and right HPC volume loss deserves further inquiry. It may be worth noting that anxiety has been associated with prolonged activity of the HPA axis. 50, 51 One possible interpretation of our findings is that anxiety promotes sustained glucocorticoid release resulting in greater HPC atrophy in regions rich with glucocorticoid receptors (eg, the HPC head). 38, 47, 52, 53 Thus, the current findings offer intriguing clinical implications that warrant further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The HPC was of particular interest for this study because it is especially vulnerable in TBI and mediates important cognitive functions known to be impaired following moderatesevere TBI. 54 However, investigation of other relevant structures that are compromised in TBI and have demonstrated associations with anxiety symptoms-for example, the entorhinal cortex, 9 medial prefrontal cortex 55, 56 and amygdala 57, 58 -would help us to better understand the role of anxiety in the injured brain.\nIt was shown that GCS scores and HPC total volumes were significantly lower for participants who participated in all three study visits compared with those who only participated in two of the three visits, suggesting that there may have been a systematic loss of participants with less severe injuries, as well as larger HPC volumes, at the second and third time points. As the findings of this study were relevant to HPC volume change rather than static HPC volume, these differences may not have biased our conclusions, however. Critically, right HPC (the region of interest in this study) total volume change scores did not differ significantly between participants with complete versus incomplete data. Nonetheless, the conclusions of this study may be most relevant to individuals with more severe TBIs.\nGiven that different imaging parameters and quantification techniques are likely to yield different HPC volumes, generalization of our volumetric findings to other studies or samples should be made cautiously. 54 However, a manual for HPC segmentation protocol recently published by the EADC-ADNI group (www.hippocampal-protocol.net) [59] [60] [61] suggests that the segmentation process used for the current study is likely to be consistent with what has become the recommended protocol for best practice in HPC segmentation.\nAnother potential limitation of this study is that the level of anxiety observed in our sample is lower than that found in other studies of moderate-severe TBI. 28, 31 Therefore, the volume loss observed as a function of self-reported anxiety symptoms may not be representative of the moderate-severe TBI population as a whole. Indeed, the findings may underestimate HPC volume loss associated with more severe anxiety in chronic moderate-severe TBI.\nAlso of note is that our analyses do not account for the relationship of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with HPC volume loss. Many previous studies have shown that PTSD is associated with reduced HPC volume, [62] [63] [64] [65] including in the right HPC 64 and HPC head. 65 It should be noted that, while PTSD is indeed an important consideration for mild TBI, 66 PTSD is much less prevalent in moderate-severe TBI because of lack of memory for the event due to PTA and/or loss of consciousness. Where there is PTSD following a TBI, this is found to occur predominantly in those with a PTA of less than 12 hours. 67 All but one participant in our study had a length of PTA greater than 24 hours, suggesting that PTSD likely does not account for significant outcome variance in our study, though in the absence of a measure of PTSD on the participants, this cannot be confirmed."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current study provides the first evidence that anxiety symptoms predict right HPC volume loss in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI, particularly in the right HPC head. It is also the first study to demonstrate a predictor of neurodegeneration in chronic moderate-severe TBI. What is particularly clinically important about the findings is that the relationships are \"post-injury,\" offering the possibility that treating anxiety symptoms after TBI may reduce the observed HPC atrophy. Future research is needed to replicate the current findings and assess whether treatment of clinically elevated anxiety could mitigate the HPC atrophy that is observed in the chronic stages of TBI."}, {"section_title": "Authors' Note", "text": "A previous version of this article appears in a master's thesis available online through the University of Toronto's research repository, TSpace."}]
