An increasing proportion of Idaho's ground water being used for drinking water and large increases in the inputs of nitrogen to ground water in Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Twin Falls Counties have prompted concerns about the quality of the resource. The probability map was constructed to assist regulatory and resource agencies in managing land use and protecting water resources.\nTo construct the probability map, hydrogeologic and anthropogenic data were integrated with ground-water quality data in a geographic information system. The resulting data set contained land use, geology, precipitation, soil characteristics, depth to ground water, nitrogen input, and ground-water velocity information for each of the 1,365 samples collected from 1991 to 2001. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the most statistically significant variables related to the detection of elevated nitrate concentrations.\nThe resulting multivariate probability model showed that ground-water velocity, nitrogen input, precipitation, soil drainage, land use, and depth to ground water were significantly correlated with elevated nitrate concentrations. A subset of the water-quality data set was used to verify these results. Linear regression of the percentage of predicted probabilities of elevated nitrate concentrations and the actual percentage of elevated nitrate concentrations with the model data set and the verification data set both showed good correlations: r-squared values were 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. Statistical comparisons of both data sets showed that ground-water samples containing elevated nitrate concentrations had significantly higher probabilities of detection (p < 0.001) than samples without elevated nitrate concentrations. On the basis of these results, a map identifying the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations was constructed. High-probability areas on the map coincided with regions of agricultural land use and high nitrogen input, except in southern Gooding County and western Jerome County. In these areas, high ground-water velocities representing a predominance of regional ground water resulted in a low probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations. Areas of poor prediction"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION Introduction", "text": "Ground-water quality is an ongoing concern in Idaho. In 1990, ground water accounted for nearly 85 percent of the State's drinking water; in 1995, it accounted for almost 95 percent (Solley and others, 1993, 1998) . Previous studies have detected high concentrations of nitrate in many aquifers in the State (Rupert, 1994; Crockett, 1995; Rupert and others, 1996) . Predominant sources of nitrate in much of the State are inorganic fertilizer, cattle manure, and legume crops (Rupert, 1997) . Because of the stable agricultural industry and large increases in the dairy industry, especially in Gooding, Jerome, and Twin Falls Counties (Idaho Agricultural Statistics Service, 1999; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1999), resource managers and planners are in need of tools to aid in land-use planning and water-resource management and protection.\nMaps showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations can be important tools to aid regulatory and resource-protection agencies. Ground-water probability maps indicate the predisposition of areas to ground-water contamination on the basis of natural and anthropogenic factors. These maps also can assist other organizations such as agricultural producers; city governments; planning and zoning commissions; and State programs related to Wellhead Protection, Drinking Water, and Best Management Plans.\nFor this study, elevated nitrate concentrations or nitrate detections are considered greater than 2 mg/L. A nitrate concentration of 2 mg/L was chosen because it was the concentration used in other similar studies in the area (Rupert, 1998; Donato, 2000) and is high enough above local background concentrations, typically below 1 mg/L, to indicate an anthropogenic influence on ground water."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Most maps showing the vulnerability of areas to ground-water contamination are created using a geographic information system (GIS) to combine hydrogeologic and anthropogenic data such as land use, soil properties, and depth to ground water. One of the most widely used methods for producing such maps is the DRASTIC model (Aller and others, 1985) . The DRAS-TIC model uses point ratings assigned to seven factors: D epth to ground water, net R echarge, A quifer media, S oil media, T opography, I mpact of vadose zone media, and hydraulic C onductivity of the aquifer. The ratings are added together in data layers in a GIS to make a vulnerability map. DRASTIC models usually are not calibrated to actual ground-water contaminant concentrations.\nAnother method of vulnerability mapping uses statistical correlations between environmental factors and water-quality data. A statistical method used to calibrate nitrate vulnerability maps with water-quality data was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program for the upper Snake River Basin, southeastern Idaho (Rupert, 1997) . This method differs from the DRASTIC method by calculating the probability of contamination on the basis of statistical correlations between measured nitrate concentrations in ground water and land use, soils, and depth to ground water.\nThe statistical method was improved by using logistic regression to relate water-quality data to hydrogeologic and anthropogenic data. Two probability maps for detecting the herbicide atrazine have been created, one for the upper Snake River Basin and one for the western Snake River Plain (Rupert, 1998; Donato, 2000) . These maps are called probability maps because they delineate areas according to the probability of detecting a contaminant in that area. Calibrated contaminant probability maps are a superior predictive tool over maps produced using the modified DRASTIC method because the actual probabilities of contaminant detection can be quantified.\nThe probability map developed in this study encompasses a smaller area than those of Rupert (1998) and Donato (2000) . To compensate for the difference in study area size, a larger scale soil data set was used than in the previous two studies. In addition, an aquifer property data layer was incorporated to provide another explanatory factor for the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations in ground water."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The main purpose of this report is to document the construction and verification of a map showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations in ground water in south-central Idaho. A GIS was utilized to examine relations between elevated nitrate in ground water and hydrogeologic and anthropogenic factors.

This report also documents the construction of three GIS layers-a nitrogen input layer, a ground-water velocity layer, and a depthto-water layer-used to construct the probability map. Logistic regression was used to develop the statistical model that predicts the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations in ground water."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author wishes to thank the following people and agencies: Dave Clark and Patrick Lambert (USGS) for valuable discussions leading to improvements in the probability model, and Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) for providing an extensive additional nitrate concentration data set."}, {"section_title": "Study Area Description and Geohydrology 3 STUDY AREA DESCRIPTION AND GEOHYDROLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area Description and Geohydrology", "text": "Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Twin Falls Counties compose the study area, approximately 7,800 mi 2 ( fig. 1 ) in south-central Idaho. Most of the study area is in the downstream part of the eastern Snake River Plain and is bounded on the south by mountains and tributary valleys. About 57 percent of the area is rangeland, 17 percent is flood-irrigated land, 11 percent is sprinkler-irrigated land, and the remaining 15 percent is composed of six other land-use types. Most of the agricultural land in the study area is near the Snake River. The area is predominantly semiarid; mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 in. on the Snake River Plain to 40 in. on the mountains in central Cassia County.\nThe study area ground-water system is made up of three types of aquifers: a regional basalt aquifer, a local perched alluvial aquifer, and tributary valley aquifers. The regional basalt aquifer underlying the eastern Snake River Plain provides most of the ground water that moves through the study area. The local perched alluvial aquifer ( fig. 1 ) overlying the eastern Snake River Plain near Minidoka and Cassia Counties and the tributary valley aquifers in the southern part of the study area are lesser sources of ground water."}, {"section_title": "Snake River Plain Aquifer", "text": "North of the Snake River in the study area is the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, composed primarily of vesicular and fractured olivine basalt flows (Quaternary age) of the Snake River Group (Whitehead, 1992) . Individual flows average 20 to 25 ft in thickness. The top of the basalt is generally less than 100 ft below land surface throughout this part of the plain, and the thickness of the basalt is more than 1,000 ft in places.\nLayered basalt flows in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer yield exceptionally large volumes of water to wells and springs. Individual well yields are some of the highest in the Nation and typically range from 2,000 to 3,000 gal/min to 7,000 gal/min with minimal drawdown (Whitehead, 1992; Lindholm, 1996) . Transmissivity can be as high as 1,000,000 ft 2 /d and is commonly 100,000 ft 2 /d (Whitehead, 1992) . Locally, aquifer properties can vary greatly; however, on a regional scale, the variability is minimal.\nRegional ground-water movement in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer is from the northeast to the southwest (Rupert, 1997) . Ground water is discharged as springs and seeps to the Snake River along the reach bordering Twin Falls, Jerome, and Gooding Counties. Ground-water discharge to this reach of the Snake River increased considerably from about 1910 through the early 1950s (Kjelstrom, 1992) . The increase is attributed to recharge from surface-water irrigation north of the Snake River. Since the early 1950s, ground-water discharge to the Snake River has decreased as a result of increased ground-water withdrawals for irrigation (Moreland, 1976) , the introduction of more efficient irrigation practices such as conversion from flood to sprinkler irrigation, and local droughts (Kjelstrom, 1992) . Changes in ground-water levels reflect the same long-term downward trend as does spring discharge (Kjelstrom, 1992; Rupert, 1997) ."}, {"section_title": "Perched Aquifer", "text": "An alluvial aquifer is perched above a blue-clay layer about 60 to 120 ft below land surface in the Burley area ( fig. 1) (Rupert, 1997) . The top of the clay layer was previously mapped on the basis of data from several hundred well-driller records. Water in the perched aquifer moves northward at the southern boundary of the perched aquifer and westward near the western boundary. The water level in the perched aquifer is about 100 ft above that of the Snake River Plain aquifer. Recharge to the perched aquifer is predominantly infiltration of irrigation water. According to local accounts, the perched aquifer was formed in 1907 when a canal network was constructed through the area to transport irrigation water. Reportedly, several wells completed in this aquifer go dry seasonally after irrigation ceases and become operational again after the start of the next irrigation season."}, {"section_title": "Tributary Valley Aquifers", "text": "Tributary valley aquifers south of the Snake River recharge the regional Snake River Plain aquifer in the study area. They are predominantly alluvial deposits that interfinger with the Snake River Group near the mouths of the valleys. A more complete description of these valley aquifers is provided by Mundorff and others (1964 "}, {"section_title": "MODEL DEVELOPMENT APPROACH", "text": "The creation of the elevated nitrate probability model closely followed the methodologies of Rupert (1998) and Donato (2000) . These studies were based on water-quality data from the Idaho Statewide GroundWater Monitoring Program (ISGWMP), a cooperative program between the USGS and the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR). Rupert (1998) used additional data collected as part of the USGS NAWQA Program. Because of poor spatial distribution of ISGWMP and NAWQA nitrate data in the study area, it was uncertain whether a statistically valid model for producing the probability maps could be built. Thus, additional nitrate data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) data base, the IDEQ, and the ISDA were used for this study.\nThe elevated nitrate probability map was constructed using mostly existing data and published interpretation of flow, statistical methods that model the probability, and a GIS to process the data and produce the final map. First, all the nitrate data from the multiple data bases were combined. Next, relations between the occurrence of elevated nitrate concentrations and hydrologic and anthropogenic data were evaluated using a GIS and statistical methods, including logistic regression. Univariate relations between elevated nitrate concentrations and land use, geology, precipitation, soil characteristics, depth to ground water, nitrogen input, and ground-water velocity were examined to identify explanatory variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the best probability model using a forward-stepwise approach with a backward check for elimination. The final model then was entered into a GIS to produce the probability map."}, {"section_title": "GROUND-WATER QUALITY DATA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ground-Water Quality Data", "text": "Initial phases of model development incorporated nitrate data collected as part of the ISGWMP, the USGS NAWQA Program, and a 70-well network established in Cassia and Twin Falls Counties specifically for this study. Primary objectives of the ISGWMP are to characterize the quality of water in Idaho's aquifers, identify temporal trends in water quality in individual aquifers, and identify potential ground-water quality problem areas (Idaho Department of Water Resources, 1995; Neely, 2001) . The goals of the NAWQA Program are to (1) describe current water-quality conditions for a large part of the Nation's freshwater streams, rivers, and aquifers; (2) describe water-quality trends; and (3) improve understanding of the primary natural and human factors that affect water-quality conditions. The purpose of the additional 70-well network was to aid in calibrating nitrate probability maps in areas of Cassia and Twin Falls Counties where the data were sparse. All the nitrate data used for this study were collected during 1993 to 2001. If multiple data were available from a single well, the most recent data value was used. All programs used a random well-selection process and similar sampling methods.\nSpatial distribution of wells in the data sets indicated that most of the sampled wells were located in agricultural and urban areas. Thus, initial statistical models based on these data were of limited use for describing the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations in other land-use areas. To create a more robust statistical model, additional nitrate data collected during previous USGS studies and stored in the USGS NWIS data base were used. Nitrate data from the following data bases also were added to the data set used in final statistical modeling: ISDA -ground-water monitoring networks and a one-time analysis of water from wells at dairies statewide; and IDEQ -individual ground-water quality investigations statewide and the Drinking Water Information Management System public water-supply data base ( fig. 2 ). Samples collected and analyzed by the USGS were reported as nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen (NO 2 + NO 3 -N), whereas the remainder of the samples were analyzed by the Idaho State Laboratory and reported as nitrate as nitrogen (NO 3 -N). Concentrations of nitrite in ground water in the study area are typically negligible; therefore, USGS, IDEQ, and ISDA analyses were considered equivalent. Some of the additional nitrate data did not have associated well depths and water levels, so a generalized depth-to-water map was used instead of well depth and water-level measurements during statistical analysis. Also, some of the additional samples were collected from wells that were not randomly selected; however, these samples accounted for only a small proportion of the total data set. The entire data set consisted of 1,365 samples, collected from 1991 to 2001.\nA random selection process in the statistical software was used to extract 20 percent of the sample set for external verification of the statistical model. The verification data set was viewed in a GIS to ensure a good spatial distribution. "}, {"section_title": "Ground-Water Quality Data 7", "text": "Of the 1,095 samples used to create the statistical model and probability map, 656 contained an elevated nitrate concentration; 161 out of 270 samples in the verification data set contained an elevated nitrate concentration ( fig. 3 ). Nitrate concentrations in both data sets ranged from less than 0.05 to 26 mg/L as N; concentrations in 56 of the 1,365 samples exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contaminant level of 10 mg/L."}, {"section_title": "HYDROGEOLOGIC AND ANTHROPOGENIC DATA Hydrogeologic and Anthropogenic Data", "text": "Hydrogeologic and anthropogenic data used in this study included land use, precipitation, surficial geology, soil characteristics, nitrogen input, relative groundwater velocity, and depth to water. These data are available in GIS format from a variety of sources.\nTwo sets of land-use data were evaluated for use in the probability model, one from IDWR and one from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). The IDWR land-use data were combined from three maps: one showing vegetation type, one differentiating between sprinkler and flood irrigation, and one differentiating between dryland and irrigated agriculture. The BOR mapped land cover at 1:40,000 scale from digitized high-altitude aerial photographs taken in 1987 and field checked in 1992. Each land-use data set has unique advantages. The IDWR data were mapped at a scale of 1:100,000 and included classifications for lava flows, dryland agriculture, rangeland, and forest land. The BOR data were mapped at a larger scale but combined forest, lava flows, and rangeland into one classification, native lands. Each land-use data set was evaluated separately to determine which produced the best correlation with elevated nitrate concentrations.\nA precipitation GIS data set (1:250,000) was obtained from the Water and Climate Center of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and represents mean annual precipitation from 1961 to 1990.\nThe surficial geology GIS data set is from a digitized geologic map by Whitehead (1986) at a scale of 1:100,000.\nSoils data were obtained from the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data base. SSURGO soil maps are made at scales ranging from 1:12,000 to 1:63,360. Previous analyses of the Snake River Plain by Rupert (1998) and Donato (2000) incorporated data from the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO), which are mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. Use of the SSURGO soils data set provided a significant improvement over the STATSGO data set as a result of the small size of the study area. The soil characteristics evaluated in the statistical model were percentage of clay content, drainage, hydrologic group (infiltration), percentage of organic matter, permeability, and soil depth. Clay content, organic matter, and permeability were assigned values for each soil horizon. A weighted average for the entire soil column was used for the statistical analysis.\nThe method used to estimate nitrogen input and losses for the study area followed that of Rupert (1996) . Five sources of nitrogen were considered: fertilizer, cattle manure (dairy and beef), septic systems, atmospheric deposition (precipitation), and legume crops. Nitrogen losses resulting from crop uptake; decomposition of previous-year nonleguminous crop residue (chaff); and storage, volatilization, denitrification, and inorganic nitrogen availability of cattle manure were estimated.\nMost nitrogen sources, including cattle inventories and crop acreages, were determined using 1998 data. Exceptions were fertilizer sales data, which were available only for 1997, and population household estimates for septic systems, which were adjusted to approximate 1998 data.\nBecause specific nitrogen application maps were not available, nitrogen input values were distributed according to the BOR's land-use coverage. For example, nitrogen input from fertilizer was applied only to land classified as residential or agricultural (dry farmed and flood-or sprinkler-irrigated land), whereas nitrogen from septic systems was applied only to residential or commercial land, because actual septic system locations are not available. The nitrogen input categories are county-level estimates distributed by land-use type in each county, so artificial discontinuities occur at county boundaries ( fig. 4) .\nNitrogen fertilizer use for the six counties in the study area were estimated using a method similar to that of Battaglin and Goolsby (1995) . The ratio of expenditures for commercial fertilizer in the county to expenditures for commercial fertilizer in the State was multiplied by the number of pounds of nitrogen applied in the entire State to obtain the number of pounds of nitrogen applied in each county, as follows: The calculations of nitrogen fertilizer use are based on State and county fertilizer sales figures from the 1997 U.S. Department of Agriculture's Census of Agriculture. The nitrogen from fertilizer data then were divided by the total number of agricultural and residential acres in each county to obtain the number of pounds of nitrogen applied per acre. The resulting county-level nitrogen inputs for the six counties in the study area are reasonable when compared with those reported for the six-county study area in 1991 by Battaglin and Goolsby (1995) .\nNitrogen losses from crop uptake were applied only to agricultural land-use types. Estimated nitrogen losses from crop uptake were calculated by determining the amount of nitrogen required for a given crop and yield and dividing by the acres of that crop in a county. Crop uptake was estimated for the major crops grown in each county based on 1998 data (barley, sugar beets, potatoes, oats, wheat, and corn).\nFor this study, nitrogen input from legumes was estimated using alfalfa and dry bean crop data by county from the ISDA for 1998. Crops belonging to the legume family, such as clovers, alfalfa, and beans, establish a symbiotic relationship with microbes that reside in nodules on the roots of the host plant and fix atmospheric nitrogen. The nitrogen fixation rates were from a report by Goolsby and others (1999) : 194.5 lb/acre for alfalfa and 53.7 lb/acre for dry beans.\nNitrogen input resulting from dairy cattle was estimated for areas with known dairy operations and weighted by the average number of dairy cattle per facility. These data were provided by ISDA for 429 dairies in the study area, probably a fraction of the total number of dairies (Danielle Bruno, Idaho State Department of Agriculture, oral commun., 2000) . A contour map, based on the dairy locations and number of dairy cattle, was created in intervals of 50 animals, ranging from 1 to 450 animals/mi 2 . This allowed a range of nitrogen input values, in pounds per acre, to be assigned spatially on the basis of the estimated number of animals per acre. It was assumed that dairy cattle produce 0.45 lb/d of nitrogen per animal (Lander and others, 1998) .\nRanges of nitrogen losses from storage and application of dairy cattle manure summarized by Rupert (1996) were used. The type of manure storage system determines the amount of loss, ranging from 80 percent in open lagoons to 15 percent by spreading. Volatilization losses (mostly as ammonia) during field application range from 5 to 30 percent. Denitrification losses (loss of inorganic nitrogen by biological conversion to nitrogen gas) range from 0 to 40 percent depending upon soil drainage properties. Rupert (1996) summarized a range of estimates of organic nitrogen from cattle manure that is not available for plant uptake or leaching. This organically bound nitrogen breaks down in the soil over time and forms inorganic nitrogen, which then is available for plant uptake and leaching. Nitrogen availability ranges from 45 to 96 percent after the first year of application. The mean of these nitrogen loss ranges was subtracted from the nitrogen inputs.\nBecause information on the spatial distribution of beef cattle was not available, it was assumed that all beef cattle were located on agricultural land, although this necessary simplification does not account for cattle on rangeland. The number of beef cattle in each county, obtained online from the Idaho Agricultural Statistics Service, was multiplied by the average daily amount of total nitrogen in feces and urine produced by each animal (0.305 lb/d/animal).\nNitrogen losses from beef cattle manure differ from those of dairy cattle manure only in the method of manure storage and application. Losses resulting from storage of cattle manure range from 0 to 80 percent, depending on whether the cattle were grazing on open rangeland or in feedlots and pens. Rupert (1996) indicated that 85 percent of the total nitrogen remains when manure is applied directly to the ground. This is between the range of 70 to 95 percent retained by mechanical spreading methods. Because denitrification and organic nitrogen losses occur once the manure is applied to the ground, they are the same for both dairy and beef cattle.\nNitrogen concentration data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network were combined with long-term average precipitation data to compute the annual amount of nitrogen input by precipitation at any point in the study area. Precipitation contains small but measurable amounts of nitrogen. The GIS data set (Molnau, 1995) showing 30-year average precipitation ranging from less than 5 to 40 in/yr was used to calculate a precipitationweighted mean deposition of nitrogen, in pounds per acre.\nTotal nitrogen input from domestic septic tank systems was estimated by multiplying the average amount of total nitrogen generated per person by the average number of persons per household and the number of households using domestic septic systems in each county. Estimates for the number of households were based on 1990 census data and 1998 updated population estimates. The exact distribution of septic systems in the study area is not well known. Therefore, it was assumed that nitrogen input from domestic septic systems occurs chiefly in areas designated as residential or commercial lands, according to the BOR land-use maps.\nRelative ground-water velocity data were obtained from an adaptation of a three-dimensional, finite-difference, numerical model of the eastern Snake River Plain regional aquifer system (Garabedian, 1992 ; David Clark, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 2002)( fig. 5 ). Velocity data had not been used in previous probability models for the Snake River Plain (Rupert, 1998; Donato, 2000) . However, it was hypothesized during this study that the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations at any given location in the study area might be related to the rate of groundwater and solute movement through the study area's aquifer systems. Conceptually, areas of high groundwater velocity result in a greater amount of regional ground water containing low nitrate concentrations that mixes with surface recharge containing higher nitrate concentrations. Thus, areas of high nitrogen input and high ground-water velocity will result in a lower nitrate concentration than will areas of high nitrogen input and low ground-water velocity. Water-quality samples collected from spring discharge originating from high ground-water velocity areas indicate a greater proportion of regional water than do samples from spring discharge originating from middle to low ground-water velocity areas (Clark and Ott, 1996) . Ground-water velocity values for the areas outside the flow model were determined by visually defining aquifer boundaries based on topography and using ordinary kriging to statistically interpolate velocity values from the flow model to the outside areas. The final ground-water velocity layer resulted in either high or low velocity values with a small transitional zone ( fig. 5 ).\nDepth to ground water was based on a map developed from more than 1,000 water-level measurements. The water-level data were compiled from the USGS NWIS data base. Water-level measurement reselection followed the methods of Maupin (1991) . Ordinary kriging then was used to interpolate water-level values at 0.5-mi grid intersections. The resulting raster data set was converted to a vector GIS data set, and 20-ft waterlevel contours were created."}, {"section_title": "ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTING ELEVATED NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUND WATER Estimating the Probability of Detecting Elevated Nitrate Concentrations in Ground Water", "text": "A map showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations was constructed using a GIS and logistic regression statistical methods (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) in the following steps:\n1. Data describing nitrate concentrations and hydrogeologic and anthropogenic variables were combined into one GIS data set providing each sample location with all of the corresponding GIS data. The GIS data set was then exported to a statistical software program for logistic regression analysis.\n2. The data set was statistically analyzed to evaluate individual (univariate) correlations between nitrate in ground water and hydrologic and anthropogenic characteristics and to identify those variables that correlated significantly with elevated nitrate concentrations.\n3. Multivariate forward-stepwise regression with a backward check for elimination was performed to identify the most significant variables to include in the probability model, after which each variable's significance was verified.\n4. Various tests, including an external data verification check, were conducted to determine how well the probability model represented the data.\n5. The final multivariate model was entered into a GIS and the probability map was constructed.\nFor this study, the nitrate concentration in ground water was converted to a binary dependent variable, elevated nitrate detection, whereby the nitrate concentration was either greater than 2 mg/L or less than or equal to 2 mg/L. For logistic regression analysis, the dependent variable is categorical.\nIndependent categorical variables included geology, land use, soil hydrologic group, and soil drainage. To prevent divergence of the logistic regression model resulting from small populations of data in some categories, similar categories within the geology and landuse data sets were combined to provide an approximately even distribution of data per independent variable. For example, the BOR's land-use categoriesnative, gravel pit, idle, and public land -each contained few nitrate samples but, when combined into one category termed native, the amount of samples was adequate to compare with the agricultural categories. By generalizing some of the categories, a meaningful logistic regression model was obtained. The other independent variables were modeled as continuous; therefore, precipitation and depth-to-water values at sample sites were assigned midpoint values between contours. For example, sample locations between depth-to-water contours of 40 and 60 ft were assigned a depth-to-water value of 50 ft."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods and the Logistic Regression Model", "text": "A variety of statistical methods was used to evaluate correlations between the nitrate concentration, or the binary-variable elevated nitrate detection, and the independent variables. Spearman correlation tests were used to determine significant correlations between continuous variables and nitrate concentrations or elevated nitrate detections. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Ott, 1993) was used to determine whether differences between nitrate concentrations and the different categories of a variable were significant (for example, significant differences between nitrate concentrations and different land-use types). This test also evaluated whether differences between elevated nitrate detections and nondetections for a continuous variable were significant.\nLogistic regression was used to predict the probability of detecting nitrate concentrations greater than 2 mg/L in ground water. Logistic regression is a statistical method similar to linear regression. However, in logistic regression, the output variable is binary, and any number of the independent variables can be categorical (discrete).\nMultiple logistic regression (more than one independent variable) software generates several parameters that determine the predictive success of the model, including the likelihood ratio statistic (LR), rho-squared value (similar to an r-squared value in linear regression), standard error, and p-value of the model parameter coefficients. The model prediction success table also was used to evaluate the probability model's classificatory power. These evaluation parameters are described in a report by Rupert (1998) . For a thorough description of how these parameters are created, refer to Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) "}, {"section_title": "Univariate Analysis", "text": "Univariate analysis was performed on all variables to determine initial correlations with nitrate concentrations and elevated nitrate detections and to identify key variables that were likely to be significant in the final model.

After the land-use categories were regrouped to account for small populations of wells in certain land-use types, comparisons were made to determine whether statistical differences between nitrate concentrations among the land-use categories were significant (p < 0.05). Differences between nitrate concentrations and each of the three land uses classified by BOR, and between nitrate concentrations and two of the three land uses classified by IDWR were statistically significant (fig. 6) ; however, the IDWR data resulted in a better fit of the logistic regression model. Among the best predictors of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations using univariate analysis were ground-water velocity, geology, both land-use data sets, depth to water, and soil organic matter content (table 1) . Except for soil depth, the other variables were weak predictors of elevated nitrate concentrations. Due to a logistic regression coefficient p-value of 0.994 and Spearman and Wilcoxon p-values of 0.155 and 0.151, respectively, soil depth was omitted from further analysis. The remaining variables were carried forward for multivariate logistic regression analysis."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis", "text": "Several methods can be used to create a multivariate logistic regression model. Most involve a stepwise procedure, whereby variables are added to or deleted from the model one at a time on the basis of statistical significance until the model that best fits the data is achieved. Statistical significance is assessed by the likelihood ratio chi-square test (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) , which commonly is used to compare nested models. The method utilized to develop the preliminary model was a manual forward-stepwise selection of variables with a backward test for elimination. This method uses a statistical algorithm to determine the initial variable with the highest statistical significance to create the best single-variable model. A two-variable model then is created by adding each of the remaining variables one at a time to the single-variable model and determining which, if any, significantly improved the one-variable model's predictive capabilities. This process of adding variables continues until no remaining variables significantly improve the model. After each successive variable is added, each variable included in the present model is individually tested for removal, because a variable found to be significant at an early step could become insignificant at a later step. In developing the model, variables were considered significant at the 95-percent confidence level (p-value < 0.05).\nThe variables selected for the preliminary model were ground-water velocity, nitrogen input, precipitation, soil drainage, land use (IDWR), and depth to water. After the preliminary model was created, several steps were taken to verify the suitability of the selected variables. First, the variable coefficients were compared with those produced by the univariate model to check for large differences in magnitude that would indicate that an excluded variable was needed to adjust the fit of the variables that remained in the model. Another method to identify intervariable influences is to reenter all the unselected variables one at a time into the model to check for large changes in coefficient magnitudes, then reevaluate the likelihood ratio test to check for significant model improvement from the unselected variables. Each continuous variable then is checked for linearity in the logit (a transformation of equation 2). Linearity in the logit is assumed in the beginning stages of model development and needs to be verified for the continuous variables in the final model. Lastly, interactions between variables are checked. Variables interact when one independent variable is not constant over levels of another independent variable (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) . Interactions are checked by adding an interaction term into the model and checking for a statistically significant improvement by the likelihood ratio chi-square test. Interactions need to be scientifically sound to remain in the probability model. For the present model, all the preselected variables remained after the verification tests were conducted and no interactions were added. The final probability model is listed in table 2."}, {"section_title": "Construction of the Elevated Nitrate Concentration Probability Map", "text": "Multivariate analysis resulted in a best-fit probability regression model that incorporated variables for ground-water velocity, nitrogen input, precipitation, soil drainage, land use (IDWR), and depth to water. The regression model then was used to construct the probability map. Each of the final data layers were combined into one GIS data set, and a probability value was calculated using equation 2 for each of the 251,000 polygons that resulted from intersecting the GIS data layers ( fig. 7) ."}, {"section_title": "EVALUATION AND TESTING OF PROBABILITY MODELS Evaluation and Testing of Probability Models", "text": "Several tests were conducted to evaluate how well the model fit the data as a whole. The likelihood ratio statistic tests the hypothesis that all coefficients except the constant are zero, similar to the F test reported for linear regression. The log likelihood ratio for the final probability model was 297.305, which is chi-squared with eight degrees of freedom and a p-value of < 0.001, indicating a significance level greater than 99 percent. McFadden's rho-squared is a transformation of the likelihood ratio and is similar to the r-squared value in linear regression. McFadden's rho-squared values between 0.20 and 0.40 are considered satisfactory (SPSS Inc., 2000) . The rho-squared value for the final probability model was 0.202. For the 1,095 samples in the model data set, the model correctly predicted 64 percent of the data; 70 percent of the samples that contained elevated nitrate concentrations were correctly predicted and 55 percent of the samples that did not contain elevated nitrate concentrations were correctly predicted, also known as the sensitivity and specificity, respectively. A probability cutpoint of 0.50 was used to determine the data set's sensitivity and specificity. Probability values ranged from 0.04 to 0.95. The results of this model closely match those of Rupert (1998) and Donato (2000) .\nThe range of the model's predicted probabilities of detecting elevated nitrate was evaluated by comparing groupings of predicted probabilities with percentages of actual elevated nitrate detections in each group. This was done by performing a linear regression between the percentage of actual elevated nitrate detections in a group and the predicted probability of elevated nitrate detections in a group. The probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentration was calculated for each sample, and the data set was sorted by ascending probability and divided into categories of 10 percent (0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29, and so on). The percentage of elevated nitrate detections in each group was calculated, and linear regression was used to compare the percentage of actual elevated nitrate detections with the predicted probability of elevated nitrate detections in each group ( fig. 8) . A perfectly fit model is one in which linear regression produces a slope = 1, y-intercept = 0, and an r-squared value of 1. The probability model resulted in a slope = 0.958, y-intercept = 0.007, and an r-squared value of 0.959. The Wilcoxon test was used to determine whether differences in probability ratings between samples with elevated nitrate detections and samples without elevated nitrate detections were significant ( fig. 8) . The difference between the high-probability values for elevated nitrate detections and the lowprobability values for nondetections was significant (p < 0.001).\nThe probability model also was compared with the extracted verification data set of 270 samples. The verification data set was randomly selected from the combined data sets of the USGS, ISDA, and IDWR. The verification samples were combined with the GIS data sets, and the probability for detecting nitrate was calculated for each sample using the logistic regression ing probability of elevated nitrate detection, and the percentage of actual elevated nitrate detections in each interval was calculated. Linear regression was used to compare the predicted probability of detection in each group with the actual percentage of detections. The predicted and detected values ( fig. 9) were strongly correlated with a slope = 1.060, y-intercept = -0.039, and an r-squared value of 0.973. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the verification data set, as for the model data set, indicated that the difference between the high-probability values for elevated nitrate detections and the lowprobability values for nondetections was significant (p < 0.001). For the 270 samples in the verification data set, the model correctly predicted 74 percent of the data; 83 percent of the samples with elevated nitrate were correctly predicted, and 63 percent of the samples without elevated nitrate were correctly predicted. Probability values for the verification data set ranged from 0.06 to 0.91. As with the model data set, a probability cutpoint of 0.50 was used in determining a correct or incorrect prediction.\nAlthough the study areas and data sets for developing probability models in the two previous studies (Rupert, 1998; Donato, 2000) were different from those used for this study, several of the significant explanatory variables were the same-land use, soil drainage, and depth to water.\nThe areas of predicted high probability for elevated nitrate detection ( fig. 6 ) coincide with areas of high nitrogen input and agricultural land use in northern Twin Falls, northern Cassia, and southern Minidoka Counties. An exception to the correlation between predicted high probability of elevated nitrate detection and areas of high nitrogen input occurs in southern Gooding and western Jerome Counties. This area is characterized by agricultural land use and high nitrogen input but was predicted by the model to have a low probability for elevated nitrate detection. The low-probability prediction is a result of high ground-water velocity, which represents the large amount of regional ground water moving through the aquifer. The model correctly predicted that high nitrate concentrations are less likely to occur in areas where regional ground water predominates and moves relatively faster through the aquifer than in areas where ground water moves slower and has a larger component of recent recharge from the surface.\nAreas of lowest probability, primarily in Cassia and Twin Falls Counties, relate to high-precipitation, high-elevation areas with no agricultural land use, but the low-probability areas in northern Minidoka County and northeastern Lincoln County result from deeper ground water.\nThe effect of the soil drainage variable is most prominent in southern Minidoka County, a region of The effect of the soil drainage variable is most prominent in southern Minidoka County, a region of predicted low probability, where the soil above the perched aquifer is poorly drained. Soil drainage describes the frequency and duration of wet periods of the soil (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) . Soils with poor drainage are typically water saturated and can have reducing conditions that may lead to denitrification, which reduces nitrate concentration (Goolsby and others, 1999) .\nIncorrectly predicted elevated nitrate detections tend to congregate along a transition zone between high and low ground-water velocity areas in Jerome and Gooding Counties, where the probability model underpredicts the probability of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations ( fig. 10 ). Although this area does have high nitrogen input, the ground-water velocities are in the middle range, which indicates a mix of regional ground water and surface recharge that results in nitrate concentrations above 2 mg/L. The probability model slightly overpredicts elevated nitrate detections in the perched aquifer area ( fig. 10) . Probability values in this area range between 0.50 and 0.60, just slightly over the cutpoint of 0.50 for correctly predicted elevated nitrate detections."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY Summary", "text": "Ground-water quality is an ongoing concern in Idaho because of rising nitrate concentrations in an increasing number of wells. The concentration of nitrate in ground water is related to anthropogenic factors; therefore, planning tools are needed to aid local managers in assessing the potential effects of land-use decisions on nitrate concentrations in ground water.\nGround-water probability maps can be an important tool for resource-protection and regulatory agencies to help protect ground-water quality. In previous studies (Rupert, 1998; Donato, 2000) , the U.S. Geological Survey developed preliminary maps showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrate in ground water of the upper Snake River Basin and the western Snake River Plain. This study used similar methodologies while compensating for differences in study area scale. The resultant probability map provides an additional tool for managing the increase of nitrate concentrations in south-central Idaho ground water.\nThe elevated nitrate probability map was produced by overlaying ground-water quality data on hydrogeologic and anthropogenic geographic information system (GIS) layers. The GIS layers consisted of two land-use data sets (Bureau of Reclamation and Idaho Department of Water Resources), precipitation, geology, nitrogen input, six soil characteristics, ground-water velocity, and depth to water. A statistical software program was used to conduct a variety of statistical tests, including logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A forward-stepwise logistic regression and subsequent model-fit assessment with model diagnostic evaluations resulted in a final probability model based on groundwater velocity, nitrogen input, precipitation, soil drainage, land use (Idaho Department of Water Resources), and depth to water.\nThe final probability model performed well in predicting areas of elevated nitrate concentration (greater than 2 mg/L). A linear regression of the grouped predicted probabilities of detecting elevated nitrate concentrations with the percentage of actual elevated nitrate detections showed strong correlation with an r-squared value of 0.96. A similar linear regression of a verification data set also showed a strong correlation with an rsquared value of 0.97. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between samples with and without elevated nitrate detections for both the model data set and the verification data set. Areas of high probability of elevated nitrate detections coincide with areas of agricultural land use and high nitrogen input except in southern Gooding and western Jerome Counties, where high ground-water velocities predominate resulting in low probabilities of elevated nitrate detection. This finding reinforces the concept that high nitrate concentrations are less likely to occur in areas where regional ground water moves relatively quickly through the aquifer than in areas where ground water moves more slowly and is recharged from the surface. Incorrectly predicted elevated nitrate detections tend to be congregated along a transition zone between areas of high and low ground-water velocity in Jerome and Gooding Counties indicating a mix of regional ground water and surface recharge."}]
